Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees.,Apple,11,iOS
Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon,Apple,11,iOS
"So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there’s a glitch in the front camera’s portrait mode. That’s fine, it may happen. But what’s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!",Apple,11,iOS
"I've been an android user all my life until I decided to try iPhone XR for iOS. Loving the camera and battery life is an absolute joy to have. It's been more than one month since I got this phone and I'm loving it. Face ID works flawlessly even in the dark and the dual sim function is working like a charm, I'm using Vodafone as my primary sim and Jio as e-sim and have faced no problem whatsoever.",Apple,11,iOS
I was delivered a phone that did not work immediately after removing from the box. I was not able to return it as I need to first check with Apple. Apple service told me that the phone was lying without charge since 5 months and hence the battery failed. Now I have had to leave the phone with Apple for repairs and waiting for them to replace the battery. Please answer this: WHY SHOULD I RUN AROUND FOR THE SUB PAR QUALITY DEVICE WHEN I WAS SHIPPED A DEAD PHONE? Last time I ever purchase a phone online,Apple,11,iOS
"It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I’m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase.",Apple,11,iOS
The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.,Apple,11,iOS
I'll use this review to mostly say what I'm not a fan of in this particular iPhone model.,Apple,11,iOS
Went with the iPhone XR after over a month of consideration.Amazon was offering some really good discounts and felt the time was right to upgrade having used the iPhone 6 for four seamless years.,Apple,11,iOS

Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon,Apple,11,iOS
"Don't buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They didn't change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating.",Apple,11,iOS
Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. It’s heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Don’t watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy. Yes it’s expensive. Sometimes rather many times money is not worth than happiness.,Apple,11,iOS
"Great Phone, I am happy with the phone so far.",Apple,11,iOS
"There are lots of reviews on net for XR, I would give just quick points based on my experience of XR 128 GB.",Apple,11,iOS
Don’t buy this phone only waste of money it hang’s many time.,Apple,11,iOS
STEVE JOBS GONE i phone gone !!!!!!,Apple,11,iOS
Single SIM is working fine but if you are using E-sim in this phone. Not good quality for dual sim. Many times Number showing switched off.,Apple,11,iOS
It is not supporting any type of sim.. the network gets disconnected after sometime only,Apple,11,iOS
"i always was unhappy with the size of my previous iPhones (iPhone 7 and 5s), I badly needed an upgrade and but don’t have the budget of 1lakh so I took my chances with XR and I am very happy with my purchase.",Apple,11,iOS
This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down.,Apple,11,iOS
Im facing some speaker related issues and had given my handset XR 64 Gb in service center they denied to repair the same stating that the handset is fake and not valid for any warrenty,Apple,11,iOS
All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well. All in all XR rules,Apple,11,iOS
I had taken the phone but the phones holds too many defects and issues. When we talk the mouth pice is not that precise to hold you voice creaky the voice is not audible if the phone is even partially away from your chin/mouth.,Apple,11,iOS
there are two angles from which smartphones are generally looked. and i will be very honest in this review so that a genuine user can understand if he really wants apple!,Apple,11,iOS
"Smooth as butter, no lag and awesome display with superb camera..Just the perfect phone",Apple,11,iOS
"Using around a week now. It’s snappy fast. Power efficient. Gives a back up of a whole day on average use. It has a single but impressive rear camera. Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides. Display is crisp.",Apple,11,iOS
This is by far the best smartphone i have ever owned.,Apple,11,iOS
"A Perfect Phone with a great camera, great performance, Great look, Great Battery life and a good Display. Worth the trade off. Perfect size",Apple,11,iOS
"NEVER BUY it from Amazon. VERY POOR PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER CARE.i bought it and received it on 3.10.2019 and noted a crack on right top corner of display which was visible when the plastic sticker was removed and complained to amazon customer cell on 4.10.2019. they assured a replacement. nothing happened. when i called them a number of times, they simply tranfer my calls to diiferent sections and then assurinng call back and then not calling back. Apple says it is the duty of amazon to take measures for replacement. Still left nowhere with my money gone on a damaged product.",Apple,11,iOS
Extremely easy to use. Good specifications.,Apple,11,iOS
Best iPhone I’ve used. Sold my one plus 6 and got this one. The screen is not an OLED so you miss out on deep blacks and saturation. But I noticed the colours are better than the older iPhones with LCD. It also has thick bezels which take some time to get used to. An OLED screen on this would’ve been wonderful but apple being apple wont do that!,Apple,11,iOS
Poor Front camera cannot take photo with light at background (photo attached),Apple,11,iOS
"This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market.",Apple,11,iOS
This Appario seem to be a fraud. My shipment has been smartly tampered and the have managed to overcome the security features. Even iPhone package back label have been tampered. Amazon Customer Care on phone or Twitter is of no help. I need to return this and get a replacement.,Apple,11,iOS
"Most Beautiful, Fast and Stylish iPhone, I've ever Had..",Apple,11,iOS
"Like every time, Apple has again mesmerised me with it’s great creation iPhone XR. The best part in this is when you unbox your brand new iPhone. It comes with an earpod, and a Fast charger. I understand that the price might be a bit high but trust me, it’s worth it. The camera has the best feature within it. Everyone says that it’s an LCD screen but you’ll nit be able to differentiate just by looking at the screen. The phone performance  is more faster now. And last but not the least, I am really impressed with the battery back up time. It really lasts. Full charge at 10 am and then the whole day on Cellular Data, I have played PES2019, played some songs from YouTube Music, hovering on Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook and clicked some good photos. When i came back home at 11 o’clock, i still had 66% charge. That’s what we needed in an iPhone.",Apple,11,iOS
iPhone XR is excellent there is no doubt about this. This first time my iPhone experience. Its great experience. But I am very unhappy about the dual sim performance (May be solved the problem).,Apple,11,iOS
Been a iPhone user always. Upgraded to iPhone XR from iPhone 6 and I have no regrets. Just love the ease that face recognition brings in... freedom that 128GB memory brings in... and of course peace of mind that Apple brand name brings in.,Apple,11,iOS
the phone wont turn on,Apple,11,iOS
"A lot of criticism of iPhone XR has been about its inability to take portrait pics of “only human faces!” Though true, it can be very easily overcome by downloading a software app - “Halide!” That and the near negligible difference in viewing experience, puts it on par with iPhone XS and even XS Max! Just go for it— the 256 GB storage version!",Apple,11,iOS
Prices have fallen by rs 10000 in 3 days after I bought my phone. I feel terrible.,Apple,11,iOS
Faulty product delivered and Amazon not giving replacement. Cheating with customer and just making money by scam and defective product delivery. Phone is not usable as display stop working randomly and screen freeze suddenly. I have provide problem video also to Amazon within 10 days of replacement but Amazon just making money and cheating with customer.,Apple,11,iOS
 Iphone is good but probably I have received a defective piece from amazon as I am facing issues with software. Further never heard a iphone to be hanging issue but I am facing the same and attached a video regarding it. Within a month I have to visit customer care and still facing issues. Very worst experience don’t buy it from amazon.,Apple,11,iOS
"Super fast performance, long battery hours, little heavier than iphone 7 plus. Overall good phone.",Apple,11,iOS
Has many drawbacks. Apps developed for iPhone by Indian Companies aren’t good at all. You can’t even do a normal Tatkal booking as irctc app unavailable. No dual Whatsapp so one number is wasted. No dual Facebook as well. Maximum 5gb cloud backup storage limit. Apps get refreshed more frequently and better enhancements on android. No features to search apps easily. Wifi once disconnected loses auto join features. Maximum 100 call records that’s very very annoying. Difficult to set primary and secondary sims in sms. Some Whatsapp features missing.,Apple,11,iOS
It is heavy weight if u use more ull feel it hard to hold on regular note!,Apple,11,iOS
"There have been multiple issues faced since started installing and restoring from icloud. Gets hanged/stuck, suddenly WiFi gets disconnected and doesn't get connected till restart, deteriorated network speed on usage of the data.....",Apple,11,iOS
"First off, the battery life is INCREDIBLE! This is the first phone I have used where I can get two days of use on one charge! I would regularly charge the phone overnight one night, then go to bed at midnight with 55-60% left the next night, leave it unplugged, and finish the next day at midnight with around 2-5%. The size of the phone was just just about perfect for holding/scrolling with one hand, and I usually wear men’s size medium gloves for reference.",Apple,11,iOS
"When compared with XS only visible difference would be screen, that too when kept side by side.",Apple,11,iOS
"Awesome IPhone.. I have upgraded from iPhone 6 and I can notice the significant different in display, touch and XR is certainly faster. It’s worth the upgrade..! Thank you Amazon for delivering it securely.",Apple,11,iOS
"Got this phone for offer price. Everything is great from packing to delivery. Display quality is very good. Dual sim option is very good, got esim from airtel",Apple,11,iOS
Bought this phone for my wife. She's absolutely happy with the phone.,Apple,11,iOS
I want to replace this iphone because since i got this it worked well for w week then later on its speed is slowed down and even it hangs sometimes. Its been 3 months since i got this n i m already irritated with this device. My lighting usb has already stopped working .,Apple,11,iOS
Great phone for better photos and low light battery usage is much better than X,Apple,11,iOS
"So overall it’s a pretty nice phone, I honestly don’t find much difference in features from my old iPhone 6. Apart from face recognition.",Apple,11,iOS
Good phone,Apple,11,iOS
"I’ve been using Android for close to a decade and now decided to check out iOS. Thanks to Amazon Prime Sale, got iPhone XR for a discounted price(Still expensive), Coming to the iPhone itself, after using phone for 3 days, below are the points I came across.",Apple,11,iOS
Using this phone since 2 months. Here is my review. Hope you will find it useful.,Apple,11,iOS
"I was skeptical looking at some XR reviews and also purchasing an iPhone off Amazon (previously always bought through Apple Stores). However, so far happy with what I have. The delivery was fast (on Prime, next day); all original packing (phone box) and phone is working fine. Touchwood - no issues. The Deal was good with the 10% additional HDFC discount. Go for 128 GB (or even higher) - the few extra thousand are worth it when you run out of space.",Apple,11,iOS
I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. There’s a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phone’s working completely fine though.  So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe it’s something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didn’t. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still don’t blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. It’s disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didn’t upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone.,Apple,11,iOS
ALL good,Apple,11,iOS
" I chose iPhone XR over x. The reasons are, it is 6.1-inch display and supports dual sim. the Battery Durability longs last. I got the Brand New peace (made in 2019, September) without any defect.",Apple,11,iOS
"During the great India sale, I saw this model on offer and my sister was dying to get a new phone since her old phone was barely keeping up. I finally made up my mind,, arranged the funds and got it for my sister.",Apple,11,iOS
"Phone looks beautiful. I bought it just one month before thru Amazon, when I put my sim it's speaker has not been working , it is difficult to listen voice sometimes it becomes disconnected. Although my android phone is working good at the same place. I don't know whom should I contact about my complaint.",Apple,11,iOS
"After transition from Android to iOS, I felt Android is more user friendly compared to iOS.",Apple,11,iOS
I am not able to activate iphone after several attempts. Today only i purchased.,Apple,11,iOS
Hello friends!! This is my honest review after using it for almost 2 months. I was using android since last seven years but then I decided to go for iPhone. Here are the pros and cons according to me which I have felt after using it for almost 2 months,Apple,11,iOS
So upgrading from 6S+ to XR. First reactions:,Apple,11,iOS
Everything look good but I never expect.,Apple,11,iOS
"Upgraded from 5s to xr after 3 years of 5s use. Purchased it at ₹37999 after low battery issues with 5s. Why I choose xr rather than iPhone 8 ,7 or even 6s even when I bought 5s after 3 years of its initial launch is",Apple,11,iOS
"Before I start this review I’ll let you know, I love the Apple brand and I’ve never used a 1080p OLED phone in my life (This screen seems perfectly normal to me). That being said I’ll dive into the review. I got this phone on the Prime day sale and I’ve been using it for almost a month now and here are my thoughts about this phone.",Apple,11,iOS
Got this product in the amazon flash sale and got a decent discount. Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You won’t find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube. Overall I feel this is one of the best iPhones apple has launched.,Apple,11,iOS
You will always feel cheated after buying an iPhone. It will get cheaper by every next 2-3 months.,Apple,11,iOS
"I have been using this phone for a while now. When I decided to buy this phone I checked on negative reviews first and after buying thought of using it first and then give a feedback. This is the perfect Phone with all advanced features for a normal user, which is worth for the price. Moving unto the flaws seen on the feedbacks, most of them complaining about the display being low resolution and LCD. In my opinion you won’t spot any difference with other iPhone displays. Another thing I’ve seen than lot of people complaining about the single camera, however, the picture quality you get will amuse you.",Apple,11,iOS
"Bought this during Prime sale. I love to use Apple products because of its simplicity. I was using iPhone 6 and thought of updating. While the XS and XS Max are more than a Lakh in India, iPhone XR is bang for the buck. The prime day deal was more sweet and surprise to me. The operation and touch responses are silky smooth. Dual Sim with the eSIM works like a charm. Rear camera is awesome with face detection AI Bookeh in Portrait mode. Screen resolution is very good and crisp without any pixel issues. It lacks 3D Touch but Apple incorporated Taptic Engine which will be updated to replace 3D Touch functionality eventually (though some are present now, it is limited). Some APPs are not good in the notch area though but it is ok to manage. Overall a nice update.",Apple,11,iOS
Received the product next day only but packaging was not good as it is a cellphone box they should cover it with some thing  Phone is working fine but some times apps automatically closes I am a bit confused if it is a genuine product or not  I would suggest people not to buy from amazon you should go to your nearest store and buy it,Apple,11,iOS
I am a recent convert from Android. I have used Samsung and Xiaomi phones earlier. Here is my initial impression:,Apple,11,iOS
"Don’t get swayed by some lame reviewers on YouTube. If u r holding out for an iPhone purchase then this is the real deal. The Xr is a jack of all trades although not excelling in any. The A12 Bionic is a beast,n’uff said already, the stereo speakers sound sweet and battery life is great. I found the most bashed about lcd display very pragmatic for everyday use.The portrait shots taken with the camera look a stunner.With the reason price cut , this has turned out to be the VFM iPhone ever made",Apple,11,iOS
Received product yesterday and product looks perfectly awesome.,Apple,11,iOS
Excellent phone. I am using it since 3 months. No problem. Classy product. Bought during Diwali sale @39k. Excellent battery backup lasting more than a day. Mind that I am a heavy user. Excellent photos. SIRI works well. No issues faced. Must go for it over other Chinese product in this price segment.,Apple,11,iOS
Iphone not working since I opened the box. Apple support of little help. Amazon not taking the return. Asking for a report from Apple. Now I have to chase Apple to get a report. Nightmare starts when you buy from Amazon.,Apple,11,iOS
There are many pros about this phone which you must be already aware of . I would like to point out at cons,Apple,11,iOS
Face ID and front camera portrait mode isn't working just after 3 months of purchase. It must be a problem of true depth sensor. My city (Imphal) apple servicing centre doesn't allow me to take for servicing and tells me to go to Guwahati (Assam) for this problem. May be a coincidence because this problem happened when I used amazon basics 10w fast wireless charger which I combine with xiaomi quick charge 3,Apple,11,iOS
I was using iphone 6 since last three years before switching to Iphone XR. The following are the things that impressed me the most.,Apple,11,iOS
Camera superb,Apple,11,iOS
I bought this iPhone XR from October Amazon Great Indian Festival at deep discount. At Rs 38000 after all discounts were applied was a WOW deal. THANK YOU Amazon.,Apple,11,iOS
"Nothing can beat iPhone. This is my fourth phone (iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 8 and now this) purchased from Amazon. All are excellent phones. Except for screen resolution, iPhone XR is nothing less than XS or XS Max. In fact, the battery life is twice as that of iPhone 8. Face recognition is excellent even in dark while android phones lack this technology. White is a beautiful color. Delivery was before scheduled deadline and in good external packing.",Apple,11,iOS
"I was bit worried about the authenticity of buying iphone online with unknown seller and by paying huge amount ,I took the  Risk but i would say amazon and seller  has done a wonderful job ,i checked the product  in apple website and its a genuine product with 1 year warranty..iphone is iphone with best processor,camera ,good battery life ,good for gaming and with  regular  updates from apple ..",Apple,11,iOS
IOS:,Apple,11,iOS
It’s a very awesome mobile. Overall it’s really good. Hats off to apple that they provide these kinda of awesome products.,Apple,11,iOS
The iPhone XR goes blank the next day!!!,Apple,11,iOS
"Was sceptical at first. But after I received the phone it’s good and in mint condition. I am upgrading from iPhone 7 and it’s worth it. My iPhone 7 was 3 years old, and was lagging before I took the leap. Camera is more like the android phone with some Chinese lens I think. Battery life is so soothing! Face recognition is like butter. (Don’t know what will happen in the future) best part upgrading is the screen  size. Totally worth it. Videos are a bit dull but for the cost it’s worth it!! Thank you amazon for not sending a duplicate phone.",Apple,11,iOS
Well after buying this iPhone i am never switching back to android.,Apple,11,iOS
In two months the phone got destroyed its screen is filled with water its ip certification is nil bloody ios.....,Apple,11,iOS
Battery quality is worst I have honor 8c and it gives 2 days backup and this phone last only 12 hours with medium usage no fast charger takes tradatitional 3 hours for full charging if u want to waste your money then go for it if u r not brand conscious buy other brands phone with much more better  configurations that too almost half of its price,Apple,11,iOS
"Their is No earpods no lightning cable or connector in that box and will call after few minutes it blanks the call,not even a bip. Kindly give me some suggestions to rectify that",Apple,11,iOS
"Got it for 38k during prime early access, one of the best purchase for value of money is considered. iOS 13 future releases might make it even more snappier and battery consumption efficiency. Played WOW Blitz in 60FPS and found no issues. Will post the PUBG and Fortnite review in few days. Battery back up is about 6hrs screen on time for apps usage scenario.",Apple,11,iOS
"I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus.  After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review.  Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, I’m feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So it’s a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory.",Apple,11,iOS
Good at 52k (the price at which I got the phone). The phone wasn’t worth 76k when it was launched but at 52k it justifies itself.,Apple,11,iOS
"I have bought it during prime sales , aside from discount i have bought it by paying just 36k",Apple,11,iOS
"It's the latest offering from I phone. Simply great. Camera is superb. The glass back looks ultra premium, though I would suggest you to get a back protective case as glass is fragile. Got it in white and had to pay 1400 extra but it looks the best in white. You are spending 60000 on a phone so what's 1400 more to get the best",Apple,11,iOS
"Fantastic mobile. Nicely integrated hardware and software nothing ever comes close to an Apple product. Smooth touch no lag, face identification works well. Camera is good. Battery lasts for 24 hours with moderate usage. Superb audio and video quality and iOS updates are always smooth. The apps are wonderful.👍Amazon delivery was on dot. the same offer is available at authorized reseller stores which happens around the time Apple launches a new version of iPhone.",Apple,11,iOS
IPhone SIM CARD SLOT NOT WORKING right from the beginning.,Apple,11,iOS
"Dude i was confused first that which one i should buy oneplus 7pro or iphone xr, so i choosen xr for 40k on offer and every thing ia good but i am dissapointed with tha camera quality and display quality really i have iphone 7plus also but the display is far far better then xr and the camera is also better but i know iphone 7plus has dual camera and that's ok but dude detailing is missing and also zooming is also missing we get digital zoom which reduces tha quality....",Apple,11,iOS
"In my initial review, I said that the iPhone XR was the best iPhone for most people right, and my thoughts about it haven't changed six months later. This is still the best iPhone in the market, offering the same smooth and terrific user experience as the more expensive iPhone XS and XS Max, but with the knowledge that you're also getting the best battery life. In fact, the battery life is at par, if not better, to what the P30 Pro and the Galaxy S10+ offer and that's saying something.",Apple,11,iOS
"I am facing cellular network issue with every new update. As per my understanding, Hardware is not compatible with the OS.",Apple,11,iOS
I have purchased this Apple iPhone XR (64GB) - Black for my use.,Apple,11,iOS
"I got it during great Indian festival for 38,000rs. Great value for the price.",Apple,11,iOS
it has a receiver failer problem,Apple,11,iOS
It was my first iphone till date i was an android user . But believe me once you get over these phones you wont switch it away,Apple,11,iOS
iPhone XR is still a great buy. The price VS performance ratio on this phone makes it a very sensible buy. If you don’t care about the latest and greatest this one year old offering from Apple is a far better buy. Only down side on the phone are as follows:-,Apple,11,iOS
"Never thought about purchasing XR but couldn't stop myself when i saw this deal . Taken sudden decision and bought this. Very much worried till the delivery suspecting that the product would be refurbished or duplicate. But amazon kept thier commitment, i received a brand new orginal iphone.",Apple,11,iOS
"First of all the Face ID is crazy fast and accurate even during pitch darkness. The phone is fast and smooth, you don’t feel like you are having just 3Gb of RAM, it handles anything you through at it without a hitch. The phone does feel premium and at the same time delicate because the backside is glass,”as you know glass is glass and glass will break”. The pictures taken from the camera are good but the lack of night scape sort of things is a con. Overall the phone is great, although the side bezels are thick, you get used to it. The LCD screen does not lack anything compared to the OLED’s in day to day usage. You just stop thinking those things when you are using daily.",Apple,11,iOS
I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 6 and was confused about iPhone 11 & iPhone XR. Decided to go for iPhone XR just from the cost perspective. Only from Camera and Processor POV there is an upgrade in iPhone 11 rest remains the same.,Apple,11,iOS
Bought it for 45k during sale,Apple,11,iOS
"I had been using iphone 8 plus before and not a single time did I ever experience that phone heating up even after extensive usage. This piece however heats up to the extent making it uncomfortable to hold. If I use it for less than 10 mins, it works fine but any usage beyond that makes it hot. And on top of that, if the brightness level is set to max, its becomes an iron box(pun intended). Not expected off an apple device !",Apple,11,iOS
"the screen has a slight dot at the bottom which i noticed while fixing guard. If it comes out as mfr defect apple will certainly fix it. but doesn't seem serious, will take to apple while it is still in warranty to know more and update.",Apple,11,iOS
Got the 128 GB model since an iPhone almost always run out of space and never have the option for an SD card like Android devices.,Apple,11,iOS
"Overall the product is good from face id to Liquid retina. One thing surely standout for me is its surrounding speakers, they are really good(as per my experience), i got impressed With the work they have put in speakers. Sound is loud and clear.",Apple,11,iOS
"M an iphone addict... my first was iphone 4, then 6 which my brother gifted me but this time i upgraded to xr with my own salary n m really happy ... specially the battery life.... and  As i dont use camera much so potrait mode is not of much use to me.. face id recognition very nice... though u dont get the feel of holding iphone as it little bit big and on bulky side as compared to my iphone 6.... rest fuctioning everything is smooth so i think its worth the purchase... and if u have iphone 6 or 7 than only go for upgrade as i did lot of research and 8 and xs and xr they almost similar except for few features....",Apple,11,iOS
"I am more or less stuck with the iOS platform because of the iwatch since I love its functionality. Upgraded from my 3yr old iPhone 7, was actually waiting for prices to drop post September this year  but when Amazon came up with an unbelievable prime deal, I couldn’t resist!",Apple,11,iOS
"Easy to use, serves the purpose. I was an android guy for like last 7 years before that was using blackberry in between switched to ios as i used iphone 5c but at that time i was a bit disappointed may be because quite young i was and a bit techie but now i use my phone for basic purposes like calls, whats app, email, social media n bit gaming n music so it really handles that well though i was a bit hesitant at first as i was used to of finger touch sensor but seriously face recognition is damn good it works like a charm even when there is no light, so if you want no nonsense stuff n if it suits your requirements then go for it as now a days even droids are equally expensive in-fact some are more expensive like fold, razr etc. so just listen to your heart and buy ios or android and you wont go wrong, though i got mine in an offer for ₹43000 for 128 GB variant",Apple,11,iOS
"Purchased this phone for a friend and he is very happy with the performance of the phone. Camera quality and features are the industry standard. For anyone refraining from buying an iPhone because it has only a single SIM slot,  please be informed that this Phone does support Dual SIM if you use E-SIM. Airtel and Jio, for now, has E-SIM facility. For a more detailed review do visit my review website at excitedneurons(dot)com",Apple,11,iOS
"Awesome product !! Far better than spending almost double for Xs, XS MAX, 11 as the difference is only display and camera. Otherwise everything is same. It would be definitely a bigger upgrade if anyone is switching from iphone 8 or 8+ to it. The entire UI is different. Icing on the cake is the PRIVACY, its the utmost priority of Apple it seems. Without you face id, nobody can see even the notifications. Its a must buy product.",Apple,11,iOS
"I still don’t understand why people are crazy about iPhone. I bough this phone for 42k in great Indian sale couldn’t find much difference so for. It’s been a week now. My old android is doing all the operation faster then this which detected my face quickly. And that has fingerprint support also. I am also crazy about this phone. My friend told that he will never go back to android again. That’s the one reason for me to buy this phone. Let me wait for one more month to become addicted.  Till then I’ll leave the rating to 4*. When you think that this phone is expensive, that’s proving that this phone is for royal customers :p. Go for it if you are affordable.",Apple,11,iOS
I have received this product with manufacturing defect in it. Screen has LED bleeding problem. Contacted the service team of Apple and they are ready to replace.,Apple,11,iOS
"The iPhone XR is by far the best that Apple had to provide in the recent years with no doubt. Right from the camera to its horsepower battery backup, everything is top notch.",Apple,11,iOS
I bought XR after 11 came out. I read a few articles and saw a few video reviews which said that the real difference between the phones was the camera and that it was negligible and not worth the price difference.,Apple,11,iOS
"My Opinion-I don't know why people are saying it's an excellent display, personally i don't like the display at all, No doubt colour accuracy is good, Touch response is good, but it not that sharp, text looks blurry.",Apple,11,iOS
"I've been using my iPhone XR for over 10 months now. So far, everything's hunky-dory.",Apple,11,iOS
"Thanks to amazon for giving it for great deal, iphone xr 128gb is absolutely fantastic, with good battery life, camera, and performance. Since 6 months waiting to upgrade from 6s, compare to 6s xr a bit bigger in screen size for me apart from that its a great device to use, thanks to the seller 3 years back got 6s from the same seller and it still works pretty well without any issues.",Apple,11,iOS
"I love this phone... especially since I wanted it for a long time... would recommend it for both apple owners and those looking to become iPhone owners...camera quality is amazing... was able to activate the esim without hazzels.. 2 reasons that I switched my old phone for...size was a concern initially since I was accustomed to only iPhone 5, SE, 6... lightning cable is a disadvantage  with this phone as the charging point n headset points are the same... but I knew it when I was getting it... so got used to it now",Apple,11,iOS
I believe firmly that this is the Best Affordable Phone Apple has ever made!!!,Apple,11,iOS
"Battery life will surely amaze the buyer, I use to charge my iPhone 7 Plus at the 100 percent to my office at 10AM  and while returning by 7 PM it used to be approx 7-8 percent remaining. I use my phone for basic tasks and PUBG during break. Now when XR came to my hand the very first day I forgot to charge my phone to 100 percent and took it to my office at 62 percent. Amazingly it had 33 percent charge while I was leaving my office and I even played 3 evoground matches of pubg that day during my break. It was my dream to have long lasting iOS enabled devices which came true with this spectacular device. One should blindly go for it if performance and battery is your huge concern.",Apple,11,iOS
Wow Wow Apple iPhone XR Looks Amazing In Stunning White Colour Thanks To Amazon For Giving For Best Price In The Market Love You Amazon For Quick Delivery But Packaging  Is Not That Great It Should Be In More Secure Packaging  When Comes To Phone After 8 Years I am Using Again iPhone Before I Used iPhone 4s Now Again Coming Back From Android Phones To IOS Makes mee feel Happy And This Phone Is a beast go for it .,Apple,11,iOS
"I was always an iPhone user  till 8+ , then thought of changing to note 8 I loved that phone too but over the period of time I started realising there is nothing like IOS and iPhone. After using two high end androids (i keep changing phones) I witched back to iPhone and OMG I must say it has even become better it is so smooth like a butter on pan and IPhone X r is beauty, Liquid Retina is awesome and beautiful will not make you miss oled also the battery back up is woooowww .  This is the first ever phone I bought thru AMAZON I was skptical but thought of taking risk and yes Amazon delivered what they promised thru FREEDOM sale got a very good deal for 128 gb everyday I fall in love with this phone ..",Apple,11,iOS
"6.1 inches screen for a phone is pretty good, feels heavy, but all that pales in comparison after the actual features of the phone are unlocked.I was informed that phone can be tracked even when switched off as per the new ios 13 update, camera quality is better , both front and back , fast charging too is great, i like the idea that the body is aluminium made as compared to the latest which after checking and reviewing holds up better after drop tests, face id recognition is great, but need back up in the form of app lock for unauthorized usage.Overall a great phone, at a amazing price, do not miss the chance to buy it, even if you feel it is heavy on your wallet, you wont get such a good phone loaded with features else where.Its like how the iphone 7 was the benchmark for future models , same goes for this phone.",Apple,11,iOS
"Excellent deals offered by Amazon 38k after bank discount.......best iPhone for every aspect.......good camera ...... battery backup excellent......... looks elegant.....feels premium in hand.....and  one think i said to all , though it's a 720p display but display is excellent quality.......there is no panicked about it....and also played 1080p video in YouTube.......so .....go for it.......this is best budget iPhone at this price point......thank you Amazon........",Apple,11,iOS
I bought 128g  at 57k performing much faster and more smoother experience on an iPhone. Battery life is above average. app switching is lightning fast.,Apple,11,iOS
I love it <3,Apple,11,iOS
I phone always like a dream phone... purchased this  in diwali sale in 38 k rs. My previous phone was s8 moved to xr and no regrates.,Apple,11,iOS
Thank you amazon i got iphone XR 64GB black variant for 38000/- on big billion day sale,Apple,11,iOS
"Top end model IPhone XR with the Price of 42k😎 Extremely satisfied... I was an android user for 6yrs and this was my first upgrade to iPhone.. Battery Standby is just next to impossible in any smart phones these days, Face ID fab!(One dis - If I covet half of my face during bike riding, it doesn’t recognise me😂)",Apple,11,iOS
"Good phone. Go for it if you want an iPhone experience. Truth be told, I do miss a finger print sensor. But, at updating to iOS 13 the performance of the Face ID head become significantly faster.",Apple,11,iOS
"I will not recommend anyone to buy XR,if you are considering iphone from camera perspective.",Apple,11,iOS
"There is nothing to dislike about this phone. I forgot Android after using this. This is superior class,u ll feel it when you hold it. Don't be a sad face for 3GB Ram, it's better than 8GB Android. Facelock can recognize you in dark. There is no finger print scanner. But still it's no issues",Apple,11,iOS
First of all got it for 38000.  Great at this price but or maximum at 45k nothing more than that for this phone.,Apple,11,iOS
I was previously a user of iPhone SE and was wonderstruck with its abilities. But due to battery life had to look at a changeover. However looking at the price was little suspicious whether the phone would be worth for the money. Here are the pros n cons...,Apple,11,iOS
"This phone is good , i got it at Rs.45000 during this diwali sale, but after using this i was bound to think on the various aspects : considering the Ram and ROM ( 3 GB and 64 GB ) in this case , is the price ok , i felt that its really overpriced, we can get more features in Phones like Redmi Note 8 pro which is priced at around 16K ( discounts and bank offer are separate) this means we are paying for brand name or goodwill price simply to Apple. Then why we are not going for One plus models made in china as Apple i phone is also made in china for your information.",Apple,11,iOS
"This is my first iPhone after 10 years of being an android user. This review is after using this phone for 2 months. The performance has been top notch, battery life is very good considering  most of my days are moderate to heavy usage I still find 20-30 % battery the next day. Camera is good too but at time you miss the secondary lens for portraits and portraits don’t work on objects.",Apple,11,iOS
"I am writing this review after using this phone for more than 10 days now . I upgraded this phone from iPhone 7 . The phone is really good , worth a buy if its on good sale .  128gb - around 55k",Apple,11,iOS
"I am using apple from last 7 years. And never change apple phone frequently. I was using iPhone 6s from last 3 years but due to less space and batter backup, I need to upgrade it. I choose Apple iPhone because it's in between AppleXS and Apple X. Hardware A12 bionic chipset with 3 GB ram give my phone high speed on top of 128GB space thrilled the whole experience. In this new apple XR I still missed the center button especially when I play the games. Camera output is an amazing especially back camera. Also would like to appreciate the battery backup, I hardly change more than one time in 24hours. Now I do not need to my battery back always along with me ROFL.",Apple,11,iOS
The best decision that I took was to give away my Samsung galaxy S8 and get this phone. I was skeptical at first considering on paper specs and the obvious inferior display. But I used it in a retail store and I didn’t mind the display at all. It was one drawback that i could live with if i was getting everything much better than on the android side at the price range.,Apple,11,iOS
"Iphone is good. It dont have fingerprint reader, only faceid and password.",Apple,11,iOS
iPhone XR performs better than those specs that it showed in paper for XR.,Apple,11,iOS
A reasonably good product if you are into the Apple ecosystem and don't want to splurge.,Apple,11,iOS
"Looks great and behaves well too. Camera is quite good for its resolution. Excellent battery life. Thank god I got rid of my android phone, finally!",Apple,11,iOS
Gifted my wife with this phone for her birthday. Thanks to amazon for the fast delivery and maintaining their quality standards.,Apple,11,iOS
"iPhone XR with A12 bionic chip with 3 GB RAM is fast. This is my 1st iPhone and I am very impressed with it's performance, processing power is fast and iPhone is very easy to use and it fits in my hand very well.",Apple,11,iOS
"This is my first iPhone. I’m happy with the performance of XR. With hdfc credit card discount and exchange of old phone, it costed me 49.7k. Both front and rear Camera quality is great, battery lasts whole day with normal use. Face recognition is better than OnePlus 6T. XR’s almost HD display  can give tough competition to major FHD phones, side by side you won’t be able to spot any difference. Display is so crisp, no eye strain. And ios is buttery smooth. XR is more value for money than XS or X",Apple,11,iOS
Best mobile compare to other Apple mobiles,Apple,11,iOS
Awesome cellphone i have ever used..i have switched from Android(OP) to ios..which I believe..it cannot be compared with any os we have  in market..coming to the device it’s really awesome battery on an average use last for a day..i don not play any game..I mostly spend time on Twitter and on other apps...the only worst thing i find is the charging rate which really sucks...it takes appx an hour to full juice. Camera has been the best...not as good as of Samsung s series and note series  but for me its the best...face recognition works like charm...,Apple,11,iOS
Its Apple so no comments on their quality and user experience. Fabulous purchase got it at 43K which is worth and enjoying it,Apple,11,iOS
"Got this iPhone XR 128GB in an awesome deal of rs. 42,999 thanks to amazon.",Apple,11,iOS
"need i say anything about this phone! it's a bomb. i bought the product red 64GB varient and let me tell you its sexier than it appears in the pictures. camera quality is really good. the portraits are awesome even though it has a single lens. the bezzel looks a bit wide compared to XS and XS Max, but if you are upgrading from Iphone 8 Plus or lower you won't find it different. The liquid display is really nice with wide range of colors displayed really well. i got this during the independence day sale for Rs.52K and its definitely a great deal. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!",Apple,11,iOS
To review iPhone! Probably the only one I could afford but totally worth it.,Apple,11,iOS
"This is the best value for money you can get. iPhone 11 has only a marginal improvement compared to iPhone XR. But the performance is almost at par with them. I had an iPhone 6s, which ran almost 4 years. Touch and feel you get from your iphone is unparalleled with any other phone.(I have used all platforms)",Apple,11,iOS
"I bought a iphone XR  ,Which has some screen and camera issues  ,screen is freezing ,Amazon custome r Care talk like we did mistake ,not gud behaviour called to amazon ,they asked to go Apple store,already visited there from apple support we got information battery already replaced of this IMIE number.I told them ,but they were not agree,they again and again saying go there,we cant replace it.we just requested also said we paid 50000 for that but they dont agree,so if you buying pn and you have any issue in phone even it would be damaged they are not going to replace IT,and this seller is selling refurbish product.",Apple,11,iOS
"Great phone! Best ux in the class, no offense android but why does my calculator need permission to access my contacts?",Apple,11,iOS
"Not sure whether genuine product. Bought it on the first day of amazon sale. Within 15days, got a vertical line in the middle of display- see photos. Have bought 5 apple devices in the past and never had any problem with any of them so far. Since the return window closes within 19 days have to now take it to apple service center. Seriously makes me thing about the originality of the product.",Apple,11,iOS
Good phone. Great screen size. But apple still has not fixed low light shooting. It still looks like crap when compared to oppo or Samsung or the +one series. It’s incredible how we end up paying so much for an iPhone which still doesn’t get its camera right. Battery life is good. Downside is the replacement of the phono jack for headphones with its lightning socket which operates both charger and headphones - which means you can only do one thing,Apple,11,iOS
I just got my iPhone XR 128GB White phone. I feel am lucky to get 12% discount on MRP. In addition 10% discount on my Credit card. Also an 2% instantaneous cashback on a special day. Total paisa-vasool!!,Apple,11,iOS
Got it after discount for 43000+ additional value of 4000 on phone exchange.,Apple,11,iOS
"Feels like got robbed by apple I bought it for 64990 and after 10 days of launching iPhone 11 the price of this phone reduced to 54990 10000 drastic drop. Its bionic A12 chip is good and smooth but battery performance is bad, and it doesn't even have  Fingerprint sensor, the face detection wont work at all angles. Need to stop buying this apple product.",Apple,11,iOS
"The iPhone is a great phone, but I am really impressed with amazon. I recieved the phone in less than 36hrs and checked the warranty and coverage on the Apple website. Everything was right in place, turns out I was unnecesarily hesitant to purchase the phone online. Also got one year screen insurance free in addition to the heavy discount!",Apple,11,iOS
 My review after one month of use,Apple,11,iOS
Pathetic experience with this phone . Bought it for 60K and not worth the price . Assembled in China and lot many issues with battery and other features . Better to buy from stores which are assembled in India and are cheaper with better quality check . Learnt hard way to never but electronics from amazon .,Apple,11,iOS
"I hot this product with 37K during big billion sale  ,and the product is super but it is not for you if you are a camera freak . Back camera and front camera both are good but front camera night vision is not enough . Over all battery life is good . Potrait mode  photos also good (without having a dual back camera)",Apple,11,iOS
"Not gonna lie while I was transferring my iCloud stuff, the phone got heated up to the point where I had to switch it off and then start over again.",Apple,11,iOS
The best camera and feel of security...,Apple,11,iOS
"This is my 4th apple product. As usual, it’s apple works fine . Will easily can last upto 4 years. Battery- is just awesome, can last u full working day with heavy useage.",Apple,11,iOS
"My second iphone and 3rd apple product so i can clearly say that if you are the first time user of apple product then you will surely give iphone XR 5 star rating but if you have been a long run user then you will think twice to give even 4 star also to this, may be after demise of Steve jobs apple has compromised with its quality, where as in till 2015 there were no comparison with any phone with iphone but now few products are giving strong comparison to it, apple is now only encashing its name but it will not good for the future of apple because now a days consumers are more aware, and if you are not giving 5 star to iphone the. Probably you have dealt with a wring product, sorry but not completely happy with XR. May be i will think next time when i will be upgrading my phone.",Apple,11,iOS
Best battery life in an iPhone.,Apple,11,iOS
"Awesome experience. Camera, performance and battery life is great. Totally worth every penny spent!",Apple,11,iOS
1.The battery life is good.,Apple,11,iOS
"I got a very bad product from Amazon. This was really not expected from Amazon. i don't know whether its an issue from Apple or Amazon. From the day it has come it started giving me issues.Issues related Hardware like Distorted sound i.e. Other person cannot listen the voice clearly, voice becomes like mute, and Software Issues like Phone getting hanged [NEVER HEARD IOS HANGING], Not able to unlock the phone moreover not able to recieve a call. I am the first time user to the iPhone and got this sort of bad experience which was never thought of or never expected.I am really disappointed with the product.Also I think Battery Life can be improved. Camera quality and Face reader is OK.",Apple,11,iOS
Thanks to Amazon for putting it on sale for 43K . Wonderful phone to have at such price . Battery life is perfect for heavy users . Although a double camera would have made it perfect.,Apple,11,iOS
Honestly speaking I love apple products due to the simple design and fluid user experience with the products. I am a fan of black but i got the Product RED as part of the amount goes for HIV research.,Apple,11,iOS
"This phone is just awesome. Screen is really good and bright, you can’t really make a difference between the screen and an AMOLED screen. I have compared them side by side. You can’t really say the difference.",Apple,11,iOS
Note: No fingerprint reader in the phone so please consider it as the review of face id.,Apple,11,iOS
"Received a faulty set, had to take it to a service centre within 2 months and they had to replace it with a new phone.",Apple,11,iOS
"Good purchase during the sale. I like it. Moved from 6 to XR, which makes it bulky in your hand. But i will get use to it. Battery backup is good. I love the photos clicked in Protrait mode.",Apple,11,iOS
"Good phone. Being a 1st time user of ios, i liked it a lot. Although the compromises made for this phone like inferior display, big bezels nd notch are cleary visible and annoying. Battery life is top notch although supplied 5 watt charger is a trash. Using my iPad charger to charge it fast. Camera gives dslr quality pics in daylight nd outdoors but night photos are below average. In total a good package to try out apple ecosystem.",Apple,11,iOS
"I purchased this phone from amazon during the freedom sale got it for an effective price 49k . This is my first iphone and honestly not regretting a bit . I was worried about the specs such as LCD screen and camera quality but it did not disappoint me this one camera on XR is 1000 times better than those Three cameras on my samsung A50 and the LCD screen hardly makes a difference its crystal clear and vibrant . The battery life is just beautiful it can stand for 48hours on a single charge . Overall it a good buy , Apple is never great with specs but the always kills it",Apple,11,iOS
The phone was not getting power on..,Apple,11,iOS
"It's a fabulous product. I'm sure everyone knows it's quality. Only one thing that I should mention here regarding the battery. I was definitely expecting a better battery life in the normal mode. It's merely giving a day with normal usage in that mode. However, in the Low Power Mode, its giving a great battery life without compromising any regular features of the phone.",Apple,11,iOS
"My experience with iPhones was never bad but this time with iPhone XR the phone started hanging from the very first month, it has not yet been a month and is already hanging.. did not expect this from apple gadgets. everything else is good the battery life , camera but its a little heavy, heats up and has started HANGING.",Apple,11,iOS
Since from a lot of months i have been waiting to buy an iPhone XR in great Indian sale and as more than I expected I bought this mobile for a huge price drop thanks to Amazon for that.I ordered on Saturday noon 1 Pm and I got the product on the next day early morning 7 Am a super fast delivery from Amazon.,Apple,11,iOS

The product is awesome i have brought the same in Sep & there has been no issues it’s currently running on IOS 13.2.2 & the phone is very fast it also has e-sim which is a major plus point face recognition is very good without any hassle & the battery is good enough to take it for a day & half. As this phone was bought after APPLE TV + was released we have received a annual subscription free with the product from 1st Nov 2019,Apple,11,iOS
Pls pls don't buy from amazon or any other site buy it from store because i got a defected xr its face id is not working and it is having heating issues and now amazon is also not replacing it,Apple,11,iOS
"This is my third iPhone and I must say - each time Apple introduces an iPhone, they improve a lot in each model. iPhone XR is one of best selling iPhone for year 2018. Its not that cheap but still standout in crowd. Its not expensive than iPhone XS but still have all the features same as other top models- only difference is OLED screen but I can live with that. Recently introduced iPhone 11 and XR have only one difference which is of Price. Most of the features are exactly same. Best Battery backup ever in an iPhone I must say. Soothing and flawless iOS.  Camera is more than average and very much improved as compared to previous generations. Glass frame back and front and very appealing to eyes. Overall, a satisfactory experience with this device. A must buy if are considering iPhone 11 but have low budget.",Apple,11,iOS
"Fingerprint reader given one star coz it has Face ID 😂, it works lightning fast (even in the dark) , super build quality, battery backup is nuts (works for more than 2 days with decent use) , Camera quality is amazing for photography and videography. Preferred product over iphone X if screen quality is not the main thing to notice (doesn't matter if you don't watch 4K videos on youtube)",Apple,11,iOS
"Using an iPhone after 6 years. Have been using Android and the transition is bit difficult as I am used to having different functions. Happy with product, it is not as bulky as I assumed. Vibrant colour and smooth functioning. Delivery was also very quick.",Apple,11,iOS

3 years with iPhone 6s and never faced a lag or hang . Battery started draining faster obviously 3 years and heavy usage did that .,Apple,11,iOS
"It is very sad to say that Amazone allow to seller to sell the Damage iPhone to their site,.I purchase iphone XR but after receiving it is found that speaker was not good,vibration problem and camera quality was bad.I contacted to Amazone customer care but they refuse to do the same.”, Amazone customer told  that everything ll be look by iPhone care.I went there and they told me to submit the phone.They r not Exchanging  the same.Its been feel like I m using 2nd hand phone.Really very disappointed.",Apple,11,iOS

Pros:,Apple,11,iOS
I had s4 and SE...bought this because it is from apple..I am not a techie.. now I like SE,Apple,11,iOS
"I received the phone on 21.10.2019, the phone operation was fine till 23.10.2019 and from next day it showed NO SIM after that all other sims were tried but the phone always displayed no sim installed and never worked again, this is the first time I had such a bad experience with Amazon, I was very very upset and today handed over the I phone Xr 128 GB to the authorised service centre in Kolkata, their response was not very positive and they will give feedback in 4-6 days time.",Apple,11,iOS
Fantastic Apple phone in this price range.,Apple,11,iOS
It is genuine and good phone. Esim facility is not working. May have to check with the service provider as well.,Apple,11,iOS
The name Apple defines everything. Awesome phone. The delivery was on time thanks to Amazon.,Apple,11,iOS
"Good battery life and attractive design,  amazon offered great discount so went for it,  little heavy but that's OK.  Overall very nice product",Apple,11,iOS
"Thanks for Amazon for genuine product and safe delivery. Couple of month back i bought this mobile for 55,999. I am quite shock to see the reduction in price. However, The mobile works absolutely fine and truely a flagship phone. Smooth UI, Outstanding camera and average battery life.",Apple,11,iOS
"Delivered with in 2 days, Thanks to Amazon Prime.",Apple,11,iOS
"Best iphone out there coming from iphone 6 , XR just blown my mind away . Below are pros n cons of the phone",Apple,11,iOS
"Phone not working. Phone was autotyping and then eventually frozen screen. I bought on 15th oct and barely used for few days. No support from amazon for replacement for defective piece. One thing to note that when I received this piece, it was in a locked bag. However, there should have been some QR code on bag which the delivery boy scans. There was no such code on the bag and the delivery center sent the qr code as whatsapp on my phone.",Apple,11,iOS
Indeed a great phone. After a month usage I can say following:,Apple,11,iOS
"While on call, if you want to see the screen, it takes time to turn on. So if you want to disconnect or add another call, frst you have to wait for the screen to turn on.. which is very irritating. One can’t even press the home button as it is not there in xr. Even aftr pressing power key, screen doesn’t turn on immediately nd pressing it twice results in disconnection of call. 😤😤",Apple,11,iOS
Thank u amazon for letting me hv this phone for under 40k. Everything about the phone is exceptional and for a change battery is excellent. Camera is good too and with dual sim capabilities the phone is sure a winner. The 11 is the same phone with just dual camera but 20k higher. So it didn’t make sense to buy the iPhone 11.,Apple,11,iOS
iOS 13 is a failed attempt from apple. The phone doesn't have a smooth wifi or network connectivity. Its worse than some other phones half the cost. Absolute disappointment. Even older phones like 5s and 6s don't show network issues while the iPhone XR has these issues. Apple support is clueless and can't solve the issue. Disappointed with this apple product. All else is good just that the phones connectivity which is the most important thing for a phone is atrocious. Avoid if u can.,Apple,11,iOS
"I’m very happy with this Apple product except call records. I didn’t find any app that suits my iOS XR in the store, rest everything works well.",Apple,11,iOS
"Everything on this XR works extremely well but the only problem that i have faced is that there is some kind of manufacturing defect in the camera lens.The photos shot have a black spot kind of smoky.Its only visible when something bright like sky or white wall is shot.Also,I’ve wiped the camera glass many times so it’s not on the camera but the inside lens.Guys,phone is quite good just be careful while purchasing can happen with anyone.",Apple,11,iOS
I have been using iPhone XR for about a week and I am impressed with the purchase and the phone has met my expectations. Here are some of the facts:,Apple,11,iOS
For: Great battery life for an iPhone,Apple,11,iOS
"Pros - good screen resolution, camera quality, battery back up is good. Good screen size.",Apple,11,iOS
"I purchased this phone (Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black) during the Amazone Deewali sale, working fine and no issues so far. Installation and configuration was pretty easy as my previous phone was also iphone. I have checked and verified the product and it is a genuine one. The convenience part  is copying contacts, photos , audio & video files took less than 2 min. In overall,  phone is  good and i got it for around 50K with a Credit card refund offer of 2.5k back after 3 months. But I didn’t receive the refund so far. Spoke to bank and they advised to get in touch with Amazon. Not sure where to reach now.",Apple,11,iOS
"I was a bit skeptical about buying it on Amazon. But happy to say..No regrets at all on this purchase. Works exactly as advertised. Absolutely no issues at all. Great battery life, nice photos. While the other variants of the latest iPhone have oled screen, this one has an lcd screen. But I don't think it is making a difference to me. The screen quality is excellent. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.",Apple,11,iOS
First time iOS user. Shifted from android to iOS finally,Apple,11,iOS
Reviewing the device after a months of usage.,Apple,11,iOS
Battery life 5 hour and heating too much...Amazon se na kharide phone Sayed discount ke Naam pe refurbished phone dete hain....iPhone me heating problem samanya nahi hain....mera phone change kardo amazonwale,Apple,11,iOS
"Nice phone got it for rs44000 after discount.with no cost emi from Amazon icici credit card. Red is beautiful. Battery back is good last for more than one day in my case. Performance, quality And finish awesome. Got update to iOS13. Amazon super fast delivery in 14hrs. Phone was covered with innovative tamper proof packaging and a code ,otp was provided to me by sms before delivery. Code to me matched with code on packaging.",Apple,11,iOS
There's no fingerprint sensor as its Iphone X series..face lock works good even in dark. Display is good fully visible in outdoors. Nice battery backup. Dual sim makes it awsome i.e one E Sim and normal one. May pay nominal fee for esim to operator. Currently only Jio and Airtel support esim..so please consider that.,Apple,11,iOS
I received this product with slight scratch on the camera edges. It can be easily noticeable and,Apple,11,iOS
My 1st iPhone. I liked it. Only difficulty I find is I didn’t get much variety Of cases and cover for this model. You have to use for hands to handle this phone because of its size and skin. I purchased it in sell at Rs 46k in Nov 19. I prefer volume keys to be in right hand side and music aux cable on top which makes a mobile easy to handle and operate,Apple,11,iOS
I had purchased the Mobile for Gift to My Son. When I started it on 23rd Oct I found that the some of the functions of the Mobile are not working. To my disapointment I could not return as it was not showing the option. The return period was valid but could not return.,Apple,11,iOS
I bought a Product Red iPhone XR in the Great Indian Amazon sale in exchange for my 3 year old iPhone 7. I got the 128 GB version for ₹ 40k.,Apple,11,iOS
Best value for money apple device right now got this iphone xr for 38k steal price totally worth it i am not an apple fanboy i use my oneplus 7 along with this device the softare smoothness is unmatchable camera is great and brand value is superb but main cons is slow charger it takes almost 3hr to complete the charge and display is also good but flat/accurate colours but i like the saturated one of my 1+ 7 but the quality is very nice closer to 1080 full hd panel for so under 45k is the best apple device you can get but if display is your main priority than oneplus 7t is a better overall device along with fast charging in this price range,Apple,11,iOS
I checked the IMEI with Apple once i got the phone and it is genuine,Apple,11,iOS
"Hi, i have purchased this phone on 27th sep,  as i am prime member so i got this product on 30th sep.  I have created apple i. D pass word..  Since morning the very next day of product received..  Today is 1st oct 2019.. In a single day..  Even not completing 24 hours..  It is getting hang..  And it took time to almost 4 hours to unlock my device..  Even though i was not able to unlock my screen",Apple,11,iOS
I have been using this Phone for about 5 months. I had used 5s and 6s plus. This phone is definitely a Big Big upgrade from former models. It’s brilliant in every possible way. The two main concerns which I had earlier with iPhones were battery life and secondary SIM card. I’m happy that finally Apple heard us and released this beast. You might wonder about thick bezels and LCD display on this phone. I bet you don’t notice them at all when you get along with this phone. No wonder why XR is the best selling smartphone worldwide. Battery life is excellent. Enough of reviews. Just go for it. You won’t regret at any point of time!,Apple,11,iOS
"A superb smartphone at this price range, bought k20 pro a few days back but wanted to get an iPhone, got it on the early prime member sale at an amazing price, everything is perfect, except for the camera which shows a yellowish pictures everytime rest of all battery, screen performance is what I needed the most and this didn’t let me down. Thanks amazon and apple for timely delivery and a best product",Apple,11,iOS
 Everything is awesome except battery.,Apple,11,iOS
This does not seem to be a genuine product. My phone goes completely silent many times and i have to restart it. The seller is not genuine. Better go for other sellers or offline.,Apple,11,iOS
"Really super experience,simply best quality,since 10 eyrs I used android and now feeling ios and iPhone quality,before I used Samsung S9plus which bought for 65k now it’s awailable for 28k means 25k worth product they sold for 65k.So my final  openion is shift to ios and iphone xr is value for money.",Apple,11,iOS
Best battery life amongst current iPhones...lightning fast with the most current A12 processor...specs are almost at par with the iPhone XS/XS Max...except for the camera and display. All in all...excellent price/value equation.,Apple,11,iOS
I purchase in amazon festive sale at 40000 which is great but if one buy under 50000 at that price also it is amazing,Apple,11,iOS
I'm regular Amazon buyer for many years now.Got my first iPhone xr delivered on 7/10/2019.But sorry to inform it stopped working from 21/10/2019.Amazon delivered Apple phone which is a most trusted brand in world.Dont know whose fault it is.I contacted Apple authorised service centre ie. Icare  who has d mobile to Bangalore.And now I'm waiting for their reply.My trust on Amazon is affected,Apple,11,iOS
Product is good what we bought from Apple store but what Amazon delivered is not good  I suspect this not good quality product Amazon delivered during sale  with in a month one day this iPhone abruptly went off ND I was not able to on it again,Apple,11,iOS
"Very beautiful phone...very long battery life, superb camera quality...thanks a lot Amazon for such great discount during prime day sale n for making it affordable ...very happy with my purchase😊😊😊",Apple,11,iOS
The phone is a little big and handling it single handed might be a problem but size matters ! The display and the face recognition is awesome,Apple,11,iOS
"Still now doing great . iPhone XR is a great phone , upgraded from iPhone 8+ , n i am totally satisfied. Yellow is a beautiful colour but the only con is the side bezels n aluminium frame colour.",Apple,11,iOS
Good battery backup so far. Little bit heavy compared to my previous version. Face unlock feature is a bit irritating sometimes as it gets unlocked sometimes when u don’t wanna do it,Apple,11,iOS
Well I’m writing this review after 3months of usage.,Apple,11,iOS
"Writing this review after 1 week of usage. Purchased the 128 GB version during the freedom sale for 57k. I was confused between One plus 7 Pro, IPhone XS and the XR and I must admit that it turned out to be a good decision. Its a classy product and feels premium in hand compared to other devices in this price range. The features that the other phones boast about are hardly being used in day to day life unless you are an avid gamer. The screen size is just perfect and quality is not bad as being highlighted in some of the reviews on youtube. Battery life is excellent, camera is very good and the phone is waterproof. Performance is excellent with A12 Bionic processor.",Apple,11,iOS
"I used to be an apple hater but no other phone ever matches the gaming optimisation of the iPhone XR/XS/XS Max. These devices with the A12 bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt. People have been complaining about the display that is basically 828p but trust me, you won’t even notice the difference between a proper 1080p screen and this one. In fact this screen looks better than most of the 1080p mobile phone screens (thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses). The camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it can’t click portraits without detecting a human face (P.S. you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits).",Apple,11,iOS
After 2 weeks of usages I am giving my review:,Apple,11,iOS
Very good phone but can be priced better as this can be considered as low in value for money otherwise,Apple,11,iOS
Best budget phone from Apple with better image stabilisation similar to iPhone XS. Battery life is extremely competitive with one plus battery's lifetime.,Apple,11,iOS
One of the best iPhone ever. Features are fabulous and battery life is excellent. On an average it lasts up to 10 hrs if you are an extensive phone user. This includes data usage and voice calling.  Bit heavy I comparison to other iPhones or android phones but might be that’s the trick it’s good on battery life. I’ll give 10/10,Apple,11,iOS
"The camera quality is not as good as I excepted it to be. It forms grams in the captures which is very evident when the pictures are projected on a monitor or a tv screen. Battery life is superb, goes more than 36 hours with normal usage until it hits the 20% low. Face recognition is perfect.",Apple,11,iOS
"Everything else is quite well except battery consumption which does not lie with the promised service that is upto 25 hrs of talktime (wireless) and upto 16 hrs of video streaming (wireless), at all.",Apple,11,iOS
"Hi, The device is good as it has everything what people look for in this price segment, i have used both i11 and XR , 11 is best because it has new processor rest XR is also a good option.",Apple,11,iOS
"I have received this product  on 1 Jul 2019, Since then i am experiencing difficulty with wi-fi Connections (taking some time to connect, not connecting spontaneously, not detecting other Wi-fi connections). Face ID not working properly (taking time to detect).  I was thinking Amazon sold the one of the damaged product. Very  bad experience with such a costly mobile ordered in Amazone",Apple,11,iOS
"Got.the product today, heating up very fast , and also not connecting to Android and other equipment. Not performing when trying to upload to cloud, etc. Connectivity issues.  Amazon says no refund , am in the.process of cancelling other buy orders.",Apple,11,iOS
"Was using X 64gb from last 2 yrs, apart from OLED display things are pretty much the same",Apple,11,iOS
Awesome...,Apple,11,iOS
"iPhone XR is brilliant perfect value for money phone giving all the specs of latest iPhone in a reasonable price. Packs the same display, screen & pixel density as iPhone 11 only difference being camera upgrade & A 13 bionic processor rest almost everything is same. Excellent battery life, display in iPhone XR. The White Colour looks simple, sober & classy unlike dull creamy white in XS or XS Max last year. All in all a very good phone & thoroughly satisfied with it.",Apple,11,iOS
This phone really feature-rich.,Apple,11,iOS
Terrific Purchase. Initially there was a heating issue while updating software but it has gone now and working excellent.,Apple,11,iOS
"Coming from iphone 8, i really didn't need this upgrade..but believe it or not..i am flattered..got a stellar deal of 40k for 128GB..camera is good from iphone 8..overall still it can't beat my other beast Samsung Galaxy S10 plus..but here is the cliche..an iphone is an iphone.",Apple,11,iOS
I was worried that it will be little oversized with 6.1 inch but fits well . Battery backup is good one full charge keeps it running for 1.5 days . Not tested camera yet . Got it in very good deal at 46k . Blue colour looks good.,Apple,11,iOS
"Third class screen and resolution, Very poor outdoor visiblity, network issue with dual sim, wifi drop/speed issue, slow data/ltr issue...slow charger included which takes ages for full charge...",Apple,11,iOS
I am writing review after two months of usage.,Apple,11,iOS
Great battery life. We're getting a battery life of almost upto 2 days now.,Apple,11,iOS
"I was skeptical at first. Some people mentioned that they received fake of defective products. In my case, the product is genuine. I checked it’s serial number on Apple website too. There is no difference in performance compared to people who bought from stores.",Apple,11,iOS
What do I say about it. Night vision of camera is not at all good. Battery literally gets drain if we use mobile data for longer time. Yes but I have to admit if we do not use mobile data or wifi battery life is longer. Face recognition is not as fast as I was thinking compare to other brands with same features. But I loved my iPhone regardless of all this little issues.,Apple,11,iOS
"All the performance is good with all working features. and the main point was the battery backup of the phone it will minimun 1 and 1/2 day and another amazing think is i got no heating in this phone while i playing games like pubg mobile,cwc2 etc.Also a measure think is there is no comparison of ios with android. IOS is best in his performance.",Apple,11,iOS
"Overall its a good product, battery backup is little bit good compared to other iphone models.., Camera is Okay but i have seen mostly noise in the photos.Sound quality is as usual awesome, and I didn’t tried underwater test but tried splash test, it’s  up to the mark upon splash proof....I am using it since last 3 months I didn’t face any problem...Go 4 It👍🏻",Apple,11,iOS
Switched to iPhone XR from MI A2,Apple,11,iOS
Amazon people are least bothered after giving a defective product.Such a costly product and i wonder how they can give such a defective Apple product and the customer has to run around with that.Amazon will ask to contact Apple support center and submit it there. and if you contact Apple customer care they will ask to contact Amazon. it just goes around like that.After submitting to Apple now amazon people are relectuent to take it back... its been 5 days without any solution...Please don't buy iphones from Amazon...Worst experience...,Apple,11,iOS
Its been one week since i bought it. I am completely satisfied with the product. Screen is quite big. Only and only problem is with the Charger. It takes 3 hours to charge the phone to 100%. Otherwise everything else is worth the price we are paying.,Apple,11,iOS
I bought this iPhone XR in the Great Indian Sale from Amazon. Product was perfectly delivered and on time. Buying from amazon is safe and you get genuine products always.,Apple,11,iOS
Guys i wud suggest u all to not buy the phone from the site as the one I have received is nt in its best condition..it’s sensor is nt working properly n it hangs too at times n I have just received the phone just 15 days back,Apple,11,iOS
I had never used an Iphone before and I was always sceptical about going for an IOS from android but after using this phone all I can say is IOS is on par with android.,Apple,11,iOS
It is my red beast.... My first iPhone experience with iPhone xr is very smooth and awesome... I got is at only 38K many many thanks to amazon for this. Battery performance is good... with normal usage it gives around 24hrs backup while with heavy usage 12-13 hrs backup u can definitely get. But charging adapter  in the box is very pathetic. I just ordered an 12W fast charger at 1K from amazon. It is a smart choice to get iPhone Xr at 40K over iPhone 11 at 59 K (Including HDFC bank offer). With your saved money u can buy different apple accessories. Overall my first iPhone experience is awesome.,Apple,11,iOS
This is my first iOS,Apple,11,iOS
"Not even completed 1 yr of this product and price reduced drastically. How you can decrease the price to such extend. I need compensation for that, amazon shall take necessary actions on it.",Apple,11,iOS
"got this for a superb deal, in fact way cheaper than mu prev 7plus which i got back in late 2016. Face ID works like a charm and the display seems great for normal usage.",Apple,11,iOS
"After 5 days of use,Love the IPhone XR Red ,Premium Top Class Phone,Got it For 38 k...Worth it...Camera Is Classy and Superb...With depth Control feature....Very Smooth...Display is good...Bit Battery is little low but compared with other iPhone it is good....Battery Standby is 10 hr when onscreen time is 8h 30m with always Data on with usage of FB ,YouTube and other apps. Face Unlock is so quick..Over all love to have this IPhone XR...Upgraded from IPhone SE to XR...So Battery is very much better for me...🥳🙏🏻",Apple,11,iOS
"This is my first apple product purchase, prior my mentality regarding the apple product was like a no Value for money company, but once I started using this phone the premium fell and the Sooth buttery flow type interface is way better than android. Happy to use this phone.",Apple,11,iOS
"Great phone. Not a gamer so don’t care about the hardware stuff. Not a pro photographer so any pictures I shoot are epic for me. Not a loud person, so speakers on low volume for me work just perfectly. Battery life should be great like most apple phones do. Display is soft to my eyes so I like that. Apple interface is the best, so nothing much to say about there.",Apple,11,iOS
Used for a day as of now. Awesome phone. Snappy and fluid in use. battery backup is pretty good (around 8 hours of screen-on time) with continouse data-on (youtube 1.5 hrs). Using 18W adapter which charges it fast. Brought 3.5mm jack connector to lightening separately. Rest all good. Will review after few more days. Thanks.,Apple,11,iOS
"I don't like the  features of iPhone XR after paying huge amount. It's battery is drained very fast . Side buttons are not comfortable while holding on hands, it pressed automatically without knowing . One-Two times it has automatically dialed the number when it was in my pocket. I think old version of iphones are  much better than this phone. I wants to return this phone but don't find any option in Amazon. Anyone please suggest how I can return it. I bought it 28 days before.",Apple,11,iOS
There is no fingerprint reader on this phone as its replaced by face recognition which works fine. User interface is same as my earlier iPhone which is excellent. Coming to battery life...it is simply amazing.,Apple,11,iOS
"Second time I shifted to Apple . But this time it was from One Plus 5T . Speed wise, battery wise, photo and video quality wise , fast charging , everything One Plus was better .  XR hangs also sometimes while receiving calls . But it was never the case with One plus .",Apple,11,iOS
"I received in original iPhone sealed package.  For its price, its best possible iPhone in market. Look and feel is great. Very fast responsive while using. Camera quality is 5-Star, Portrait pics are crisp clear. Watched some 4k and HDR videos on this iPhone, stunningly beautiful with tru color and deep contrast on this display. Its Amazing iphone, Thanks Amazon.",Apple,11,iOS
This item is faulty. Make a sure first .,Apple,11,iOS
Using this phone since last 20 days...first time iOS user...spending this much money not worth i have purchased @ 43000.00.purchased it because i have not used apple before...those who r buying it just because of Apple logo..pl don't go..those who r enthusiastic for technology must go for it...i m a simple user not very technical not very camera oriented...a simple redmi user..i m not saying phone is bad but doe those who don't have much usage with regards to its unique features should avoid this...,Apple,11,iOS
Amazing,Apple,11,iOS
"What is the main purpose of the Phone? To make and receive calls, right. This phone has a defective microphone so call quality is damn poor. You have to speak very close to the microphone for the other person to hear you. All other feature works quite well. As for photos, even Poco F1 takes better pictures. Applez just a brand as was Nokia and Blackberry once.",Apple,11,iOS
After using one month best camera and battery backup.,Apple,11,iOS
I browsed a lot about this phone all were saying it has a LCD display and which is older.,Apple,11,iOS
"Serious problem with the lower mic, after spending all that money in this faulty crap just after two months you finally feel that you are the biggest C* in India who is buying an iPhone. Fragile product, connectivity issue, software issue & restrictions  all the type of minor issues have been build up causing a serious issue. Think before you waste ya hard earned money. Apple products are degrading their quality to keep their stocks and shares up.",Apple,11,iOS
Good deal and worth buying for iPhone customers non iPhone user please don't buy as you will not find worthy but as a premium product its very good and feels better in hand superb quality,Apple,11,iOS
Bought it In white 64gb variant...looks are premium and has a large screen...being an lcd screen it far much better than other phones in competition...u get about 56gb of usable storage which is quite ok for a minimal user...performance is amazing and camera quality is average...must buy if you are looking for a budget iphone specially on offers,Apple,11,iOS
Well Apple products deliver quality and apple I phone xr is just another fine product I bought few days back which is their lowest model in iPhone x series. Well for the specs and lcd screen I really feel it's over priced that's reason it gets one star less.,Apple,11,iOS
"Happy with the phone, initially I was scared to buy as it is expensive, and reviews were making me go on doubt, but the product came in a good condition,phone is superb. Thank you amazon for fast reliable service",Apple,11,iOS
"I am giving this review after few months of use of this phone. Apple never disappoints you. As i have shifted from Google phone to Apple, was bit difficult to shift from android to ios but now i am used to it. So many hidden features which u can find it out from you tube. Camera is awesome. I also learned some extra tips for photography from youtube and it is awesome. The speed of the phone never disappoints you after loading full 64gb data into the phone. Overall phone is awesome.",Apple,11,iOS
It’s as good as buying from the store. The plastic cover which covers the box had a cut and small piece missing . Due to bad handling may be . That was disappointing to see. But then again the box was all sealed and it’s ok . Nothing to complain,Apple,11,iOS
I was more satisfied with my one plus 6T than this. Picture customization is not better than that phone. Without comparison it's ok. Battery life is good than other iPhones and the app size in store is very less compared to play store so even with 64 gb it's good.,Apple,11,iOS
This product is not adequate in terms of its quality & performance. It’s screen creates problems in eyes i.e. not comfortable for eyes. Very very bad product. Totally disappointing. Very very bad item delivered by Amazon. Heat problem is there with my iPhone XR. Amazon Sells fake iPhones. Not satisfied at all. This iPhone has also hanging problem.,Apple,11,iOS
I like the XR. This review is more for people who have yet to graduate to buying mobiles etc online. This was my first time. I had heard all sorts of stuff. But Amazon THANK YOU! Delivered in a tamper proof packing! With the assurance of a ten day window to return. The phone is working just fine!,Apple,11,iOS
"The accessories and the packing not at all good. I have used apple products, earlier packing and accessories are very good quality. Seems apple degraded the quality may be they have ordered from China. Not matching the standard of apple.",Apple,11,iOS
Very bad experience in this iPhone XR. There are so many issues in this phone like when I click on airdrop icon then phone freezes and I have to force restart to get it working.,Apple,11,iOS
"Quality at its best . You buy it and if you want QUALITY, with best user friendly interface and camera . List goes on . Its the best . That’s why u are here . Don’t think again and again . Click buy . You wont regret and yes u want it. 😉👍🏻",Apple,11,iOS
"Excellent choice from iPhone family , only sad they drop the price around 10k 2 months after my purchase. I missed the chance, lucky new customers.",Apple,11,iOS
I used it for 1 month.,Apple,11,iOS
I am very happy to this i phone xr mobile. Very good and very comfortable mobile for good battery health goood camera and good Processor proformence. No any mobile Completed to i phone . Very good privacy and ezy to use u must by,Apple,11,iOS
This is my first iPhone. Though it’s too early to give any review about the phone  as I bought it recently but  till now I’m very impressed with iPhone XR. Go for it.,Apple,11,iOS
"Well, it has been more than 2 months now and the phone has been getting compliments. It's the first iPhone that I've bought and I should say that the money you're paying for the phone is mostly for the brand image.",Apple,11,iOS
"Can't believe I got this phone for Rs 36,000",Apple,11,iOS
I have bought it around a month back. Used it and then writing a review.,Apple,11,iOS
3D camera not working .. cannot setup faceid .. always displaying Face ID not available error neither front camera portrait working .. please help don’t have a clue where to go for help,Apple,11,iOS
The most positive aspect of XR is battery life in my usage of 6 months. Downside is weight especially if you are upgrading from iPhone 6 or 7. Quite heavy due to big battery. Make sure you upgrade to iOS 13 and use the feature to optimise battery charging for longevity of battery,Apple,11,iOS
"I upgraded from iPhone 6 which I had used for 2.5 years. For me iPhone XR seems super smooth with amazing speed. I am still getting used to the absence of Home button. Using the regular charger, the phone takes nearly 2 hours to fully charge but charge lasts for more than 1 day for my regular usage. Phone is slippery - so I have added a Spigen case as well. On the whole a good iphone.",Apple,11,iOS
"Amazing product, fell in love with IPhone.In short I can tell this product is dam equal to premium 48-64 mega pixel camera phones in market,even bit more.I got it for all time low price 38000/-",Apple,11,iOS
"Flawless product, really good product thanks Amazon received the perfect without any default or any. Mobile performance is awesome as I have upgraded from iPhone 6s to Xr feeling great and enjoying the new features face unlock and others. Face unlocking is very fast and quick compare to other android phone 5 ⭐️ from my side👍👍👌",Apple,11,iOS
The product was intact. Great packaging. The phone feels amazing. It’s my first time using an iPhone and I really think the XR is worth it if you want an iPhone that doesn’t burn a deep hole in your pocket.,Apple,11,iOS
It’s my first iPhone and I am totally happy with it. One thing that iPhone XR is having a best battery backup. And I love the performance. I was having a Redmi Note 4 device previously. It was having a 4 GB ram but it’s performance was not up to the mark. I am surprised how iPhone is handling this kind of performance in only 3 GB of RAM 🤔,Apple,11,iOS
Not happy with battery life. Rest everything Is fine.,Apple,11,iOS
Just loving the XR and is super value for money. Camera quality is really good and screen size is just perfect for watching videos and doesn’t look bulky at all. Only downside is that the Apple logo at the back on the black colour isn’t visible to the naked eye so prominently. Best iPhone after the 6s model.,Apple,11,iOS
"Not bulky, not big, this is a perfect sized iPhone. Display is crisp and clear. Smart hdr photos are great. It was a steal deal for me at Rs. 37999 during special sale. Delivered within 22 hours of ordering.",Apple,11,iOS
"Got it for ₹37,999 and at this price it is the best phone. Though a little bulky and heavy but it’s fine.",Apple,11,iOS
"Camera quality, battery life both are best features of the phone. No fingerprint sensors are drawbacks. Little bit heavy than OnePlus 5T. Never used LCD screen feeling odd for a while but it's worth for money. Built is very strong. iPhone comes with some unnecessary apps I will delete it later.",Apple,11,iOS
Excellent camera and phone build. There is no finger print reader in this but Face ID is ur answer for all this. Works great and secure. Battery is super better when compared to older iPhones and lasts more then 24 hrs with calls music Bluetooth devices connected and browsing and social media. Pretty satisfied so far.,Apple,11,iOS
"Overall Iphone XR is far better than X and other predecessors. Processor is way fast than others, build quality is awesome ,face recognition is too quick and the feel which you get by holding it is superlike. One suggestion to Apple that they must include fingerprint sensors too for more effective security.",Apple,11,iOS
Bought it for 49999 on sale and it's totally worth it. I'm using iPhone for 1st time and totally in love with it. As iPhone is famous for its camera quality and it's true. Only problem is that it doesn't have the fingerprint lock.,Apple,11,iOS
I’ve been using this phone since a week now and i must say its totally worth the money! Just go for it!,Apple,11,iOS
"Device was heating too much after just a little bit of graphic works on that. Camera was too bad , front camera is no where matching the quality of IOS. I was totally disappointed with that device , I think they sold me the defective peice in the name of sale on your platform. This kind of professionalism is not good . I believe too much on Amazon but later on that I am not giving any bulk amount of order on this e commerce platform. Sorry for the comments if it hurts anyone.",Apple,11,iOS
I bought 2 iPhone XR both are awesome. Can’t really say much the phone itself makes a statement.,Apple,11,iOS
"I just loved it and I think the only thing that is lagging in this product which is the oled screen is not an issue at all , the quality of the lcd is way too good and as long as you are not too obsessed with every feature to be the latest and best , go for it , plus now they are offering at a way better price , definitely worth it",Apple,11,iOS
"Camera quality is good. 4/5 stars. Rear camera at night is awesome. It gives the effect of DSLR. Front camera is of average quality, grains when taken photo. But apple camera gives the natural effect to your photos!",Apple,11,iOS
It’s been about a month using the IPhone XR. Was too enthusiastic about buying this phone.,Apple,11,iOS
"Front camera deteriorating everyday. Front camera quality is supper flop, even worst den any minimum range android phone. Rear camera is also not at per. Face detector not so good. No finger print available hence facing problems most of the time. Overall Apple releases a bad number with this variant.",Apple,11,iOS
Got this for 38k and received within 2 day of placing order ....Apple FACE ID is the most secure way of unlocking your phone which you wouldn't get on an another phone...camera is also top notch and is the same camera which iphone XS has got  but without the 2nd  telephoto/wide angle lens....overall quite happy with the iphone xr.,Apple,11,iOS
I upgraded from my iPhone 7 to XR and I’m really happy with the performance looks and all the new features. Battery life is awesome and face recognition works perfectly even in dark. Total value for money and it goes without saying as it is an Apple product.,Apple,11,iOS
"I’m so happy to say, it’s an authentic/genuine Apple Product. Will definitely buy again. Amazon actually gives you better discounts than Resellers.",Apple,11,iOS
"Received it yesterday, transferring data from my 7 plus took a couple of hours( maybe because of net issues) but everything on my old phone came on this XR. The camera is truly amazing. Go for it.",Apple,11,iOS
"Excellent device.Value for money. I already have iPhone 11 . I bought this for my friend there is not a single difference when compared to iPhone 11. Phone display,performance,everything same as iPhone 11. I’m pretty much satisfied.",Apple,11,iOS
"Liked display, camera quality, response etc. battery life is not great compared to 5000 mih Android phone. 18 hours from full charge.",Apple,11,iOS
It’s price dropped to 39000+discounts within 20 days I purchased at 52000. It seemed to be cheated. A huge -ve impact for further purchases. Site as well as apple have to manage all things regarding it otherwise both will lose their credibility. No doubt product is good but these huge fluctuations in price ruined whole prospects of the product,Apple,11,iOS
Has every thing you might be looking in an iPhone except the oled screen camera is as good as iPhone Xs with few limitations. If display is not a big concern for you you can't get a better phone than this at this price range.,Apple,11,iOS
Amazing camera in bright light. Average to poor performance in medium and low light conditions. Great battery. Privacy protection is an understated advantage.,Apple,11,iOS
"The iPhone XR delivers fast performance, great cameras and longer battery life than other flagship phones, all in a colorful and affordable package.",Apple,11,iOS
"Everything is well checked and warranty looks legitimate. Absolutely genuine product without any doubt. Bought yellow colour, feels mango in my hand. Getting a worthy case is real challenge though.",Apple,11,iOS
"After Using IPhone 6s & OnePlus 6, IPhone XR 128gb is juz awesome in face recognition battery life & user interface, Compared to IPhone 11 lesser in cost  both are in same size & same 4G !",Apple,11,iOS
Such a good iphone for such a great price.,Apple,11,iOS
"Its just a phone with good features, if switching from android you will love using its interface, a pure secure platform and flawless running experience.",Apple,11,iOS
"Excellent product, 100% original! I bought iPhone XR 128gb in the month of October, I was double minded to buy this product as all know online products will never reach us perfectly. But my assumption failed with this product.",Apple,11,iOS
in one word I forgot android.. lovely phone,Apple,11,iOS
"This phone is a beast. Man,the phones touch response is just awesome and iOS is so buttery smooth.",Apple,11,iOS
" This is my first apple device in terms of phone. The phone is totally worth it (every penny).  The colour, camera, design, sound quality everything is just way beyond perfection.",Apple,11,iOS
Got It for 38k. Ditched One plus 7T for this and I am very happy with this decision and ya screen is great but you will feel difference if you are coming from 1440p display else it is great.,Apple,11,iOS
"Great phone camera is good ,battery is good , but it take too much time to charge , company #APPLE need to give fast charger in box. And one more thing the weight of iphone xr is little bit more than other android phone.  Other wise phone is great.......gaming performance is great😘",Apple,11,iOS
" Just want to say GO FOR IT! I got it for 39,999 in the Amazon Great Indian festival and let me tell you, it arrived within 24 hours. Even though iPhone 11 is here, it has the same exact screen and almost the same features except the camera. If you are a die hard camera fan, then go for iPhone 11. But this works for me :)",Apple,11,iOS
Don't buy iPhone on amazon,Apple,11,iOS
The phone which a person need this is one for them. Really loved it everything in this price range bybapple it is very good product. But i m not satisfied with its display. Display quality and clearity is very poor 720p video play is not good so blurry,Apple,11,iOS
THANKS TO AMAZON GOT DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AT FIRST FOUND SCRATCHES AND DAMAGE BUT AMAZON ALWAYS THERE TO HELP YOU GOT REPLACED QUICKLY WITHIN FEW DAYS AND GOT A BRAND NEW PRODUCT LIKE TO THANK YOU AMAZON AND SELLER ALSO DARSHITA ELECTRONICS IF YOU ARE THINKING TO BUY IPHONE GO FOR DARSHITA❤️,Apple,11,iOS
"camera quality is just awesome and battery backup is soo great that give you a whole day use, smooth interface,in many reviews they said display is of LCD, but when i got my device, then i Relies even that iphone have LCD display but it is great viewing display, I have no regrets to buy that iphone XR. Go for it guys.",Apple,11,iOS
Nothing to say about iPhone it’s always the best phone. But this time i have to thank Amazon for bringing the cost down and affordable during great indian sale which says IRRESISTIBLE DEAL which really is a irresistible deal,Apple,11,iOS
"iPhone XR is Good and I am yet to use all features of the phone, I had used iPhone 5, 6s. Lots new features available .",Apple,11,iOS
It’s a great phone. Cut some stars as the camera developed a problem after only 6 weeks. But Apple has fixed it. But it was unexpected and Apple and the seller must ensure that these things don’t happen,Apple,11,iOS
"The phone conks off, don’t think the OS can take load. Been just 2 months and it’s already acting up. Not sure if the problem is with the device or orders from amazon.",Apple,11,iOS
Display 4/5,Apple,11,iOS
I always thought to buy iPhone and every time I used to think that what is so special in iPhone but yes after buying iPhone XR I can say that no one can replace this. Starting from battery life to the screen which is standard and can be used one handed. Camera quality is also very good which you can realise after two three clicks only. So for me iPhone XR is a beast at low price among other iPhone models.,Apple,11,iOS
Camera not that great.,Apple,11,iOS
ORDER PLACED : 1 October 2019,Apple,11,iOS
"Pathetic product, everyday reporting new issues and going to hangout every time.",Apple,11,iOS

Apple ecosystem and almost latest specs for 40k.,Apple,11,iOS
"I purchased this beauty in big billion sale. Thus I got it at a remarkable price. The battery life is good so far and the speed has been pretty good. I love the overall look, size and design of this model a lot. The camera quality is great but definitely the higher version have a better camera quality experience to provide.",Apple,11,iOS
"I am iphone lover but always disappointed with battery back up. But after getting this superb phone my love towards iphone become more stronger. Amazing camera screen clarity, good time response, face unlock takes leasser than eye blink.amazing battery back up. Stunning look. Overall no need to purchase dslr camera. Spend money on it and u get phone for the lifetime.",Apple,11,iOS
While so far all my iPhones before had a small write up about the licensing etc at the back of the phone. This XR does not have any writing.,Apple,11,iOS
"Phone is excellent...Thanks to Amazon for their service. But the delivery was pathetic, the delivery boy refused to deliver the product. I, myself went to their office to get my phone. Hope that it will not repeat in future.",Apple,11,iOS
The camera quality in night is awesome..there are lots of features to do edit the pictures and videos. Other than that battery life is around 1.5 days in normal usage and 6-8 hours in heavy games like pubg asphalt videos YouTube play music etc. at the price of 43k it’s a steal....,Apple,11,iOS
"Received my iPhone within a week after place the order, Had issues with it but thanks to amazon for speedy replacement.",Apple,11,iOS
"Using the XR for the past 3 months and I’m completely delighted to have this model. Certainly a value for money product in the iPhone flagship category. Battery life is excellent, charging for one time in a day itself will have enough power for the remaining day. Camera quality is comparatively better than the other high end categories iPhones.",Apple,11,iOS
"Camera is very good .Screen size is just right for people like me who use phone for typing mails to watching Netflix .One can download multiple apps .Speed is good .Face recognition works like magic .Have been using iPhone since last 5 yrs ,and have found no reason to complain so far.",Apple,11,iOS
"It's one of the best phones available in the market right now. Apple always gives the best products to its customers. It had A12 chipset which can do 5 trillion operations per second. It never slows down. It gives you the best phone using experience. Go for it, if you can buy it. Don't buy Samsung products or OnePlus products they are just useless. Just go for the product.",Apple,11,iOS

I am using iPhone from last 8 years. This model no need to carry power bank(for me) compared with iPhone 6s and 7,Apple,11,iOS

There is nothing much to say specially about iPhone. I have used several android devices and I switched to iPhone XR from OnePlus 6. Simply this switching is fabulous experience to me.,Apple,11,iOS
"Got it for 39000 in the great Indian sale along with exchange (redmi 4) and using SBI credit card. Anawesome phone. Once we use iPhone, android phones seem cheap. You start appreciating little details that Apple has done to make this phone worth its price and hype. If you can afford, then close your eyes and bye it. You will not be disappointed",Apple,11,iOS
The box was not sealed and looked re-packed.,Apple,11,iOS

There is no doubt about the picture quality when it comes to iphone.",Apple,11,iOS

No lesser than iPhone XS Max,Apple,11,iOS

"What a phone . Display is not a concern ,it's brilliant even it's 720p.build is excellent .",Apple,11,iOS
"It's a very pretty and good looking mobile. Performance wise, it is super smooth. Camera is as good as iPhone XS, portrait mode is also good enough.  And the best part is, being an iphone it has a long lasting battery. Though it has LCD, but you would hardly be able to find any difference between this and OLED. Size is perfect, infact everything is perfect and cool!",Apple,11,iOS
The phone is definitely not performing per iPhone standards - frequent Call drops ( the issue is not with network provider ) and battery life is worse than iPhone 8.,Apple,11,iOS

I really need assistance on this matter.",Apple,11,iOS

It’s always a charm to use iPhone. Ease of use and fast response are key.,Apple,11,iOS
This phone is hanging n seller is not returning or changing this phone I tried many times but,Apple,11,iOS
"I have been an apple patron for a while.. I Started using the Iphone 3, 5, 6, 7 and now i bought the XR.. I honestly feel that its terrible.. Just a hype build around it.. The Face ID never works, the camera gets stuck on its portrait mode.. My honest feedback is not to but the iPhones anymore. Just will have to say that Apple lost itself a good customer..",Apple,11,iOS
"Excellent phone I am happy I suggest u all to buy with amazon, because maintaining genuine sellers with good quality products and the biggest most important  thing is  customers support I am very much happy with amazon and their customers support. Hats off",Apple,11,iOS

"While I started using this phone, I realized that my takes much longer time to get charged. However, other phones I have get charged quickly from their respective cables. I am unsure about the originality of the product received.",Apple,11,iOS
Not a value for money product.Apple is still giving 1amp charger with such expensive phone with almost 3000 mAh battery. The same charger is also  given along with 5s and also SE.,Apple,11,iOS
"Bought this cell phone for my retired father. He is a person who wanted a great battery life, good camera and great speakers with ease of use that is not present in any android cell phone in the market.",Apple,11,iOS
I have got the product in one piece that’s true but this product is defected one. Out of two speakers one is damaged. I am regulars IPhone user since from past 5 years and that’s why I could point it out. Amazon - kindly notice,Apple,11,iOS

Osome product but I suggest get iPhone 11 updated version of iPhone XR.,Apple,11,iOS
Beautiful phone. Great camera. I just feel that the phone gets heated a bit I guess I am not sure though as it’s my first day on this phone and have been constantly playing online games,Apple,11,iOS

Faulty charging cable it charges phone only from one side. When buying online check every aspect before actually using it,Apple,11,iOS
The phone I received was defective. Please think twice about buying apple products as I faced the same issue with my MacBook Air. There is no solution provided by Amazon which was surprising as they use to have very good customer care. I feel I have wasted my money.,Apple,11,iOS
The processor is not that speed as expected.,Apple,11,iOS
Just received the phone and checked for the warranty on apple site. It’s showing that purchase is not validated...after 4 hours again I checked. And smile on my face. Apple said your purchase is validated and warranty,Apple,11,iOS

It's too powerful to use. The only problem is its size and its battery. But I should tell you that if you are going to buy this phone for gaming purpose you should buy oneplus Nord. As it has the same price and a bigger battery and a display too. This phone heats too much when you play game. You dont get a night mode in the camera but if you focus on an item and then increase the exposure you will get satisfactory photo in night. Taking about the battery I you need to charge the phone 2 times...READ MORE,Apple,SE,iOS

No matter if you are a heavy user or no, this phone needs to be charged atleast twice in a day. Even if you dont use the phone for a full day it needs to be charged twice. The 5W charger that they provide in the box is slower than a turtle. It takes flat 2 hrs to fully charge.READ MORE",Apple,SE,iOS

And the battery lasts three fourth of the day with frequent usage, and a full day on regular usage(normal usage). You can compare it with one Android 4000 mah battery. There is no lag in performance, if you shift from Android to iOS then you will feel the roughness in Android and the smoothness in in iOS. And what to say about camera it is the best.READ MORE",Apple,SE,iOS

Mobile heats if you are watching videos on YouTube or some heavy app. Battery drains much fast. Also apple doesn’t provides fast charging adapter even after this phone supports fast charging. You have to charge it two or thrice in a day if you are spending more time on mobile. But at the end best budget iphone.READ MORE,Apple,SE,iOS

"This is the phone to get if you just want a new iPhone that will last you a few years, but don’t want to pay a lot for it. The iPhone SE 2020 offers ‘decent but not top-end’ performance: a good camera, enough power, a great App Store to plunder and a lighter iPhone than recent models. Battery life and screen tech could be better, the headphone jack is a miss, but - for the price - this is one of the best iPhones Apple has ever made.READ MORE",Apple,SE,iOS

For gaming screen is little bit short but not too short for video watching. If you want an iPhone but budget is low than it is best choice under 30k.READ MORE,Apple,SE,iOS

They quoted me 8700 for my iPhone 7 128 GB, but while picking up my phone they checked everything and all was working fine only the outer sides of my phone had small dots which they classified as dents for no reason and asked me to pay 2700 extra from what I had actually paid.READ MORE",Apple,SE,iOS

"The phone looks great. The red color fit and finish is elegant and top notch. Yes, it is a small device with the screen considerably smaller than present generation models, but it is for those who love smaller devices. Only negative I felt was that the edges are more than one would expect (the home button occupying bottom and the camera and ear piece at the top). Overall, at a relatively lower price tag, I believe the mobile is a good choice for its smaller form factor.Edit: As everyone has ...READ MORE",Apple,SE,iOS
