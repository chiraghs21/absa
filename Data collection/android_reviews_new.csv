"i wish they actually would stop using the 108mp sensor, in exchange for a much more usable 50mp sensor, however, since numbers can fool people, they'll keep increasing to numbers up to 1 gigapixel with some 100-in-1 pixel binning for 10mp image.
 
it's honestly pathetic that samsung keeps wanting to push the megapixel race, in exchange for only 12mp. (apple started this in 2015 with their 6s having 12mp, then after 2015, samsung copied apple with 12mp sensors up until to sony making a quad-bayer sensor for 12mp output, then samsung scammed people with 108mp number that only outputs 12mp. )
 
i don't get it. 
make a real 33mp or 40mp rgb bayer sensor with a big size for 8k recording, and a software with an option to output 20 or 25mp by downscaling the 33/40mp image to that resolution instead.
 
it had me expecting a lot on quad-bayers, 
so far the best quad-bayer/terapixel rn is the samsung isocell hmx, even though the 108mp number is a gimmick, it still gives me a lot of hope because it outputs 27mp which is quite a lot, and better than the ""industry standard"" 12mp.",Samsung,Galaxy S21 Ultra,Android

2) If apple is eating shit, Samsung doesn't need to eat that shit by copying that and being a tail of apple. If you want to compete with apple then compete in good things like there software support, customer support etc instead of gimmicking people. 
3) Removing charger brick on the name of saving climate is like ... as if we all are fool and don't understand that Samsung wants to mint more profit out of each sale. Instead remove the unnecessary paper work and provide longer software support to its customers so that they can hold these phones for more number of years and reduce the pollution per head.

There are still two versions of the same phone exynos and snapdragon, why? 
Why two versions???? 
Is there a reason?
 
Technology is now great , is there a need to make the phone with camera bump on side , that can kill a man , and phone is shaking on side because of uneaven camera bump. 
Also , curved screen , I don't know.

"Anonymous, 25 Jan 2021So, main camera is 26mm and periscope is 240mm.
But Samsung advertises as 10x. Again fooling ... moreThe main camera is equivalent to 24mm. But it's actually not really a ""10x optical zoom"" setting, because 10x optical zoom means that the focal length is 10x as high. Only then the physical magnification is 10 times as large as the magnification of the main camera. But the focal length of the periscope camera is 30.6mm whereas the main camera has 6.7mm. So the magnification is actually only 4.6 times as large. That's the reason why it needs to use a smaller sensor than the main camera. A true optical zoom setting decreases neither the sensor size nor the megapixel count. (Though in this case, due to diffraction, only the 3x camera would have benefited from a higher megapixel count).
 
Recently, a website has shown a raw file comparison in low light conditions with the S20 Ultra (not S21 Ultra) and has uploaded the dng files. It seems that 108 to 12 megapixel pixel binning doesn't work perfectly. Despite a noticeably longer exposure time, the 12 megapixel raw file didn't really look better than the raw file of a Xiaomi 10 Ultra, this means that the 10 Ultra should produce less noisy raw files in extremely low light conditions at the same exposure time. Also a OnePlus 8 Pro produced a noticeably less noisy dng file (than the S20 Ultra) with a similar exposure time. The worst raw file was from Huawei, who doesn't offer pixel binning raw files.",Samsung,Galaxy S21 Ultra,Android

Samsung should do what iPhones do with Zooming (they use a similar algorithm to Google's Super Zoom), and (Samsung should) Improve Details in the 108MP and even 12MP photos, which is, they use post processing to improve detail and sharpness even further. It's like built-in lines of the algorithms, which actually improve the resolution and detail in the final image, via AI, after the photo has been taken, thereby circumventing many of the limitations of the actual sensor, even beyond regular HDR image processing. This is the sharp contrast between the Viewfinder photo and the final taken one. That's why the final taken one, especially for zoom, in the iPhone us surprisingly good, even at 10x.

"Hello Reader, First of all, I would like to clarify one thing, I bought Google Pixel 4a for one reason and one reason only, which is: To flash and try GrapheneOS and CalyxOS on Google Pixel 4a So, If you are looking for any Android phone, please think twice before buying Google Pixel 4a. I placed the order on ""Feb 4th 2021"", and I received it on ""Feb 7th 2021"", I live in Bahrain and the phone sold by ""Triplenet Pricing INC"" in USA, That was really impressive to get the phone in just two days. Pros: 1- Very good speaker sound, for a small phone. 2- good screen resolution and touch. 3- good reception for carrier signal. 4- Only Google Apps installed by default. 5- ironically, Google Pixel devices meet the stringent privacy and security standards, that is why it's supported by GraphenOS and CalyxOS Cons: 1- I consider it expensive for its HW specs, there are other good brands in the market with higher specs with same or less price with really good feel and touch and good chassis, for example: OnePlus 7. 2- the phone edges have air pockets, you feel it and hear sound when you softly press on the edges, the body is polycarbonate unibody, what do you expect. 3- Forget to use the phone without an armor case and screen protector, you will lose it very quickly if you did not. Conclusion: If you are just looking for an android phone and you do not care about the brand, think twice before you buy Google Pixel 4a, you can find a better phone with same or lees price. Buy Google Pixel 4a only if you really want to, and you have your own reasons to do that, as I do.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

The camera is astounding. It is extremely powerful. The night sight and astrophotography settings are fantastic. Standard photos are very detailed texture and skin tone wise. The sound was very surprising, very good on not only low and midrange sounds, but clear high tones. There is a supposed sound amplifier app built in, but doesn't seem to do anything. The screen is great, color is very deep, and vibrant. All in all I was very surprised on everything this phone can do. Oh and not to mention you can actually uninstall apps you don't want that are built in, instead of just disabling then.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I used to be a samsung guy but after seeing my coworker use this phone I looked at the price and was blown away. This phone is the best bang for your buck that you will ever get out of a phone. The camera is amazing.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is really good for what you are paying for. I love the size of this phone and the design. Performance is good too with most apps. But there are some disadvantages with this phone. First: Video calls, I use facebook messenger a lot for video calls, this phone gets extremely hot during video calls and cant even handle it for an hour. No Miracast protocol which means you cannot cast/screen mirror your phone to Roku/Smart TVs without their stupid device chromecast. Google disabled this feature for business purposes to sell chromecast, even though you can still hack your phone to do this, does not worth it. Otherwise this phone is good, charges fast, runs great, fingerprint great, great colors and display, good camera, I am giving 4 star to this phone because they made ""Apple move"" by disabling my favorite feature on this phone. And if I find same size phone, with similar features I would replace it, but not with Apple. If anyone know the same size phone similar price and similar specs please let me know.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Pros: too many to list. Cons: Only 2. 1. it's not water resistant and 2. it doesn't have wireless charging. That shouldn't deter you from getting this phone. It's an amazing value for the money. Just don't take it swimming.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've had this phone since the end of November and it is now March. If everything worked on it, I'd rate it a 4. But there are so many issues! Apps will randomly not open for hours at a time. The Google search bar too. For some reason when playing downloaded music via bluetooth, the music will cut out and get choppy unless my screen is on. Honestly I'm really disappointed I bought this but the problems didn't show up until the return window closed :(",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Very good phone overall, great camera with many settings.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I am so please with this phone. Happier than with my Samsung. Yeah.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This is a great phone. Easy to use and we'll thought out. Last phone was a Galaxy and this is definitely a step up.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Finally a decent phone below 6 inch of display. Photos come out amazing. The only disappointment is no facial recognition and the battery that does not last too long... Barely a day with medium usage... However, it charges very quickly.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm going to be honest and keep it short, the phone is beautiful. BUT the battery life is not what people say it is.. I'm usually a heavy user but the first 24 hrs of owning the phone i wasn't using it much, and I am extremely disappointed in GOOGLE right now! Because the same thing happened when i bought my new pixel 3a last year i thought this was going to be better all these youtubers lie and say battery life is great and i end up buying these pixels and it's actually crap.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Just got back from the local Verizon store and they confirmed the phone is not configured to work on their LTE Advanced network. It will make out going calls but will not receive incoming calls and text messages take up to 5 minutes to be received.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
An amazing compact phone that has the perfect camera Would also recommend getting a skin for it as the case will make it bigger which defeats the purpose,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Nice phone, easy tools and operation. Camera is awesome and the battery life is good. Don't need for much so works great for me. I feel high tech with a google phone so I dig it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Bad choice. I don't like this phone. I've had it 3 months and I wish I could go back to my Samsung, it locks up. a lot. i miss the home and back buttons and I dont feel it's very user friendly. I would not buy any other google phone. LG and Samsung phones have been better than this phone... live n learn.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I had an iphone 6s and have had issues from day one with mine and the two others purchased for my Son and my Mom, battery life was horrible and dropped service constantly. My husband's Pixel had none of these issues so I decided to give it a try and I love it ! Fingerprint reader it wonderful, the phone has an all day battery life,I have all the room I need for download s and photos which I never had enough room for with my Iphone 6s,7 or 8. The flow of use is simple and very customizable.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
for the price its a great phone. love it. takes gorgeous photos,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Almost perfect! A giant in a small body. The one of a very few devices are able to read my wife's fingerprints! It makes very good photos, at least in compare with Samsung competitors. Only 1 thing is not very comfy is a missing of apps grouping.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Watch YouTube to set it up and customize,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was really enjoying the Pixel 4a. The look and use of the Pixel 4a is great but unfortunately this is the least durable phone I have ever owned. My Pixel 4a had a 1 ft drop on to a wood floor that resulted in cracks on the screen. I have had previous phones fall from greater heights with no or only minor damage. While I loved the phone, unless the durability of the Pixel phones improve I will not be sticking with the Pixels.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone for the price!! Battery is not as good as they say... besides that I really love it! The camera is excellent!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Have nothing else really to say. The phone does what I got it for and that was for the camera. Overall performance is decent and the battery life is good. So no complaints from me.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I purchased the 4a to assist with Bluetooth function for a Cochlear Implant and a Resound Hearing Aid, It functioned properly for 5 months and then does not connect properly with the Cochlear Implant and the Resound Hearing Aid. The Bluetooth is very difficult to connect to both and does not maintain a connection, therefore making it very difficult for me to comprehend on an Android phone. If you have a similar situation, I would not recommend purchasing a 4a.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Sooo kinda mad I didn't read good.... Wasn't aware this phone was used before. So FML but works good. Also charger doesn't come with it so great gotta go buy one now. Pictures are good this is night time, one with night mode the other just regular camera.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The resolution is amazing. The phone is very fast and on my network it is downloading a 234Mbps! Apps work perfect. I even play EVE online with it. Looks and runs the game amazing. Streaming tv apps are smooth and gorgeous. Really love this phone. I would highly recommend it to anyone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"What's not to love? It has all the features I wanted: Android 11, NFC, supports all US cell carriers, 6 GB memory, long battery life; great camera... etc... Got a Tello MVNO (Sprint) for only $12/month for emergency. When out and about, I can use wifi for internet and make phone calls, so I don't need data and calls. I always wondered why people are willing to pay $70+/month for cell service.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Excellent mid-tier phone below a $400 price point. A phone by Google means no spyware/malware preinstalled on the device and immediate OS updates.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I was worried about buying a phone sight unseen especially since some reviewers got bricked phones. I got my pixel and had no problems getting it on my US cellular plan. Watched YouTube all day and only went to 50% battery. Never had to even use battery saver. I was worried about the smaller size but it's a non issue. Great screen resolution and takes great pictures for a phone. I turned off the finger print recognition because with a case on it's hard to get a good read. I turned off the gesture controls instead using the normal Android three button set up since they don't work well. For 350 bucks it's honestly the best phone you can get.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Love my Pixel 4A phone! It arrived quickly and in perfect condition,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Love it it order shy it's one of the best phones I have had,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Fingerprint reader too much trouble. Phone has performed very good. Images clear. Satisfied.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"had the 3a XL before this phone, transferred everything over and its the same great feel. Very minimalistic and does everything you need it to. Its overall a bit smaller than the 3a XL which can be annoying if you have larger hands. If you have a perfectly working 3a though I wouldn't recommend upgrading, or maybe upgrading to a 5 if you really want to. 4a is a great phone for 350, makes me not want to go back to $1000 phones ever again. Tagged along with google fi google photos, google web messaging, it offers a great user experience.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I haven't noticed any lag at all. I just upgraded from a moto g phone and im very happy with the experience,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This is a fantastic phone for the price. I'm very pleased. AT&T WiFi Calling works perfectly. I live in a rural community with poor service so this feature is a must. I had difficulty finding information before I ordered about whether or not AT&T supported WiFi calling for this phone. AT&Ts website said it would need a software update. Whatever AT&T had to do happened automatically. They also activated VoLTE which they'll apparently be requiring for all phone in the near future.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My phone was dying so I selected a Google Pixel 4a to replace it. So far, there are things I really like and things I'm getting used to having to live with. The battery life is amazingly long. I do not have busy days and I do not use my phone all day. Battery life is approximately 4 days! The hardest thing to get used to is no back button. Learning how to navigate takes a little time. But, it's going well and is easy to learn. Happy with my choice, so far. It's been good enough that my husband also bought one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"People online have said that the build is less premium. Everyone places a case and screen protector on their phones so how much does that really matter? -Pure Android experience - this is a big selling point -works awesome -good sized device, feels right - great camera - price is awesome, I've paid more for smartphones and didn't get a device of this calibur - sets the bar for Smartphones Go buy this Pixel 4a!!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
THIS PHONE WAS GREAT FOR 1 OR 2 MONTHS THEN I HAVE SO MANY TROUBLES WITH THE SIM CARD READER. I HAVE TO REBOOT MANY TIMES TO HAVE SIGNAL AGAIN. MAYBE IT IS A FIRMWARE ISSUE BUT YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO THE NEXT GOOGLE UPGRADE.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Can't go wrong with this one.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"At first I had some concerns about the battery. That's true, that ""Always on display"" is the most energy consuming feature. But even with it turned on all the time, battery lasts about 2 days for me. However I have to mention, that I don't use the phone too much during the day...",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This phone is great.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I really love this phone, it takes a good photo in night for me.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The camera is simply awesome. I'm someone who would use my dslr pretty much daily to take my kids photos. The Pixel 4A has replaced and bettered my 70D. The creamy bokeh portraits are just too good. This is seriously Canon L series lens territory. (Of course I'm exaggerating a bit as this only applies to sharing the pics on whatsapp I.e screen quality). Also Won't replace dslr zoom lens shot. Great battery life and working flawlessly after a brief 100% submergence in water (don't ask). Note that Ive been using this phone daily for 6 months with zero issues.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
the google targeting ads invade and interrupt everything - I went back to my Iphone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Perfect for the price. Feels good in hand and Android 11 is a blast.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Camera is great and night vision is impressive. The battery can probably last a day if not gaming on it. It is very light but has the same size as my iPhone X. Overall great value compare to my $1200 iPhone X that I have just retired. The screen is decent but not impressive. I also had a OnePlus 8pro. I used 120HZ refresh rate all the time, but quite honestly I don't see a great difference between them. Honestly, I would really hope this phone to have a bigger screen. The specs could be identical since I don't really need that many gimmicks. At this price, I will definitely recommend this phone to anyone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4A is for sure waaay overrated! I have the Blu Vivo XL4 and much of the 4A is very similar to it! The one feature I hate on the my Blu is the call dialing UI. If an error is made in dialing it can't be corrected, you must start all over again! The 4a has the same exact dialing UI..Apps missing can't reinstall most, Screen is dim even at maximum brightness with high intensity with night light turned off! The 4A has a few improved features and a lot of bloat to disable and block tracking your activity. I was happy to get a new phone with better calling features only for this pixel 4a to have the same calling UI as the $150 Blu phone for $200 more! Ugh ugh. I was stunned! That was the one main thing I was anxious to get rid of!!! A major deal breaker!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I cant pretend like my situation is common. I've been using Galaxy phones since 2015, and even though they've made leaps and bounds in already outstanding quality, I've always been curious about Pixel phones. I figured this phone was cheap enough to be of less consequence if I ended up hating it. Which I don't! I do miss some galaxy features, but this review isn't a place for that. If you're curious about this phone, go watch the youtube reviews. They tell you everything you need to know, and from there you can confidently decide if this phone suits your needs. I love it. Special shout-out to the rear fingerprint scanner. It never fails and it's very responsive.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"A sensational balance of great features and a great price. Great pictures. Clean, no clutter Google software (as opposed to the app junk-filled phones from other manufacturers) - everything you need and nothing you don't. Great screen. Good battery life, and fast charging, f you want an Android phone at this price point there is nothing better in the market.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I just received this pixel 4a and have already experienced video call issues in terms of the quality, on whatsapp and duo. My callers get terribly pixelated videos of me that are so bad that they can't even see my face anymore. And other times it gets so blurry and visually noisy especially in low light settings, with a pixelated areas. I know it is not my internet speed because I've never experienced this before with my last pixel xl phone. I noticed this issue before the Android 11 update but it still continued afterwards. Nothing changes even after I restart. The phone is not even a day old. I'm not sure what to do now. I was so excited to finally receive the phone after waiting for so long, but this is unacceptable.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Got a new phone and battery started to swell when charged once.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"No problems so far, it's a pretty well built phone",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone a lot. It has a ton of storage, an amazing camera. My only issue is that it's a little small but that's due to being used to bigger phones. I recommend if you need a good phone under 400.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Update on April 1, 2021: I continue to experience volume & sound problem - this phone does NOT ring to alert me of INCOMING phone calls & INCOMING wechat calls. OUTGOING calls I can hear the ring tone. Sound does not always work during zoom call -- in my opinion, this phone is unnecessarily complicated with lots of google stuff. Today (Dec. 29, 2020), the volume button stopped working again. I hope it will come back and start working again. This has happened a couple times so far, each time, before I called, the volume button started working again. voice command could also be easily triggered on this Pixel phone, and this annoy/unwanted feature definitely can drive people nuts. There is NO USB-C Cable with this phone order, and I did not have one at home. I called seller's support line, but was told google store sell this USB-C cable for about $20. This was NOT convenient & NOT nice! A C-to-C cable was included, however, with C on both end, I could not plug it to my portable charger nor laptop. The Pixel 4a camera takes good photos when night sky is dark -- however, if you want to include the moon in photo, there is always a GREEN DOT in the picture near the moon. Wechat talks via this phone is super clear.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The phone is very tiny and light. Feels cheap.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The pixel 4a is a sleek, modern looking phone with no large bezels and a minimal hole punch camera. The camera is amazing, every pic I take is so clear and sharp it just makes me want to go take more pictures! The finger print scanner is very good and a nice addition for a 350$ phone along with 128 gigs of storage. The smoothness and speed of the phone is also very good. Overall, the pixel 4a has all the basics you really need in a phone and nothing more. Keep in mind it is not water proof and it doesn't have wireless charging but for 350$ who cares? Go get one now!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The two great things about the pixel are it's price point and camera. Everything else including proper camera controls was forgotten. The main issue is the screen sensitivity, I have medium sized hands and fingers (size 9-10) and am quite adept at typing but I felt like I was losing my mind and motor skills trying not to fat finger this keyboard even at its tallest and least cluttered setting. I tried typing the same sentences on different devices and would have 4x the amount of errors on that keyboard. It does help to remove the glass screen protector but then you lose that layer of protection. Most of the new features and controls advertised are either novelties, poorly implemented, or downright dysfunctional. The gesture controls are chaotic. Basically making the entire edge of the screen a very sensitive swipe to go back which is more like the slightest touch will trigger it. Trying to scroll down through a long article... nope you triggered the back button and now you have to reload the page or app. Want to pass the phone to someone to show them a photo, nope either of you will likely trigger that back command and they'll wonder what you were trying to show them. So I switched back to the old 3 button layout but wait.. they put a button for Live Transcription right next to the Square ""Overview"" button so there have been many occasions that I unknowingly triggered it and drained my battery transcribing a walk through the woods or me muttering to myself while editing or programming. I use a lot of Google Home devices and it is getting annoying to have to avoid using the world Google like your saying Voldemort in some Rowling novel or else you get cursed with the Assistant trying to search for or make a music selection based off of a snippet of your completely unrelated conversation. Finally that lovely little camera has the worst most non-intuitive controls I have ever used on a phone. Sure you can get some great astrophotography shots but you have to turn on Night Sight mode and hope that the camera detects stars or something to trigger the mode. Yes you can't shoot astrophotography unless the phone thinks that is what you want. Try fighting phone controls in the late evening in 20 degree Yosemite park and you'll wish you had a DSLR with actual buttons so you can keep your gloves on, touch screen gloves are thin and don't work well due to aforementioned sensitivity issues. Switching between camera modes requires a swipe and then some have a popup so to go from Portrait mode to Slow-mo you have to carefully swipe over a couple icons and then touch one of the options that appears above video all with a very temperamental screen. It is not fun especially when your cat is being adorable and you miss shots. I also have a feeling this phone will be quickly unsupported by Google as they are already releasing things for the 5 and 5g models that aren't available for this one. Then it seems like they are randomly and silently removing features as well. For now I am going back to my old phone (a very unsupported, cracked, and dull LG G6) and now being both burnt out from the new Pixel / Android mobiles and the IOS options, I may just relieve myself of the burden of carrying a smart phone and go for a simpler approach.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
excellent phone for the price !!! smooth and fast ..good camera and battery life !!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The last year or so has been a concern for me because I was afraid the mid-range phone I bought three years ago would break. The new offerings have not been compelling, mainly offering better cameras but not significantly stronger processing and smaller manufacturing processes (e.g. 7nm). That has changed just in the past few months and even days as there are now at least three compelling mid-range phones. I bought the Pixel 4a because it was: (1) One of the least expensive; (2) Offers one of the best OS upgrade/update policies; and (3) Is not made in China or by a Chinese firm--pick your reason not to like China right now--there are at least four. There are things I wish it had, primarily microSD and a SD 765G processor, but the 730 is plenty fast. IMHO, we're well past the stage where most people have any real need for flagship processors (gamers excluded) I'll upgrade my wife's phone to 5G later, we would mainly need that for tethering, and we don't both need it. It will probably be the 5G version of the Pixel 4a or the Samsung 51. The packaging is fairly basic, containing the phone, a 120 volt charging block, USB-C cable and a sim tool. Also, it has a very useful adaptor from the large plug USB to USB-C. That is given to help connect to your old phone, but is also useful for Yubi security keys. The phone came roughly 60% charged and didn't require any security updates that I noticed, having Android 10 installed with security updates current to within 15 days (which makes me think I missed a security update being installed). As to the phone, it's roughly the same size as what I'm used to coming from a Moto 5G Plus, but it is slightly narrower. Overall I like the change. I have not noticed any lag, and overall the phone seems very responsive, as it should coming from a phone that is over three years old in design. I wasn't sure I'd like the fingerprint scanner on the back, but that has been fine. Setting up was a bit more difficult in that the automatic transfer process the phone tries to start apparently did not work at all, or maybe I'm just not patient enough. My old phone said ""preparing"" for over 20 minutes without any indication of progress on either phone. Setting up the old fashioned way was very quick, with my roughly 150 apps installing quickly. The only problem I've had is related to my Google Suite Account, which in the newer version of Android becomes a work account. That keeps me from signing into Google maps with that account, which I'm still trying to work around. If you don't have a paid Google Suite Account this shouldn't be an issue. I also had to change a few of the default settings, but surprisingly few. I turned off a few things to save battery life, such as monitoring for songs in the background, and turned on the virtual navigation keys at the bottom of the screen, which I prefer to their gestures system. Too early to say anything about battery life because my use of the phone has been far from normal. I'll report back if it can't get through a normal day with at least 25% of battery left.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Needed a new phone since my four year old HTC was losing its flow. This pixel is really cool and works smoothly. It's not flagship but does everything you need if it's basic stuff like socials and watching vids. Would suggest grabbing a case as well. Camera is fabulous. For the price this is rare deal!!! If your on the fence on a budget phone then don't be this one is a gem.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
SOLD... I'm Pixel owner for LIFE!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

It is a pleasant phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pros: - Clean android layer experience. - A main camera but achieves its goal. - Decent storage : 128 GB, no SD memory slot. - 6GB RAM, for many open applications or other activities. - If you like small phones this is an ideal size. - Good display OLED. - Jack 3.5 mm Const: - Plastic body. - The speakers are stereo, but when listening too loud there is some distortion. - Snapdragon SDM730 instead of an SDM765, the processor is good but if you compare this phone with other mid-range phones, you have a difference.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I am in love with the camera on this phone. It takes amazing photos. The amount of space on the phone is great and I really love that it screens calls for me. This is a fantastic feature for me because it answers the calls and send a transcription of what is said to me. The battery on this phone is crazy. It even can handle PokemonGo.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"While the phone seemed awesome at first use I have had it for just over a month and I am now spending another $150 bucks to replace the screen? WTF! They claim it has water damage but I spent the money to buy a premium case and in general, take care to keep it well away from water so this phone when from being a deal to being a waste of money. If a phone can not withstand some humidity or a slightly damp finger what is it really even worth? I am not saying it should be able to handle being dunked into a glass of water but a damp finger waking up my phone to check a recipe shouldn't cost me $150 bucks every few months. Save your money do not buy get something that can handle the basics of life.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pros: - Small enough to properly fit in my hand Cons: - Atrocious battery life. (And I don't use it that often) - The finicky ""swiping"" you have to do for everything. 10/10 would not recommend.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The main selling point of this phoneis the pure Android experience. Pure Android isn't very good. The phone cannot transfer files via usb, and the help doesn't work. There's only one entry in the help page, and it directs the user to an option that is grayed out. There is no further help. Google advertises their spam blocker. But the user must decide if a new number is spam or not before reading the new number's message. A user can't read the message and then mark a new number as spam. The swipe commands (back, home, etc) conflict with homepage navigation. There's no way to mute a conversation in Messages other than blocking the senders. The phone has many annoyances like that and very few optoins to correct them. It just isn't very good.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It's OK,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pixel 4a was the home run Google needed , the software master that pixel devices always are , amazing camera , battery life and performance for it's price , the 730g on paper may seem pretty slow , but in real world use Ive found the performance only to slow down a few times in some heavy games , but overall it plays games quiet well , the lack of wireless charging and waterproof isn't a big deal to me but would have been nice . Google killed it with this phone and it's well worth the hard earned money.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition. I simply want a phone that doesn't lag. The camera is great. Battery life is better than I expected. I don't think I'll fill the 128gb of storage. I hold on to my electronics for as long as I can, so if this will last me more than two or three years, then I'll consider whatever Google has at that time.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone didn't last a year. It started jumping all over when I opened. I don't know the proper terms for this so I'll describe it. A green block appears around the object that it's on.

After 4 weeks of use, i am averaging 3 days on battery life. I have good cellular and 4G signal where i live, so that may help. Probably why my old phone lasted over 5 years with just 1 battery replacement. I love not having extra Samsung or AT&T software.

"I wish the call volume would go a little higher, but it is still a great 5 star phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I don't care for 5G so this was the best option for me. You get nearly all the same features as the 4a 5G and the 5, minus a few gimmicky camera tricks for recording videos. I think I'll live. The battery lasts all day with heavy use and the charger is fast. 0-100% in one hour. The google pixel experience is all here and for this price, that's a steal.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone for the price. I def do not regret it. Same exact size as the original Pixel but bigger screen. Phone snobs will probably find something to complain about, idk. But for me, I really can't find much to complain about.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It's a good phone so far. Battery life could be better but for a budget model it's ok,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
So imagine buying a cheap android and putting an expensive camera on it. That's what this phone is. I usually get 100 dollar androids where the phone freezes and the battery life sucks and the phone is alowt. Well all of this stuff happens to this phone but the only pro is the camera is spectacular. It's literally one of the best cameras I have ever had. So if you want an ok phone with a great camera this is the phone for you,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Call reception is terrible. Had same carrier with old phone... now with this phone, it keeps cutting in and out.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My Pixel 2 was a great camera phone but it was showing its age. I shopped and compared. I really wanted my next phone to have an optical telephoto lens. But the few phones that have that feature are at least 3 times as expensive as the Pixel 4a. If it had a telephoto lens at a similar price it would get 5 stars. (I don't understand the need for the wide angle lens on other new models of the Pixel.) I could take a ""real camera"" with me, but I have found in recent years that when I do, I still use the phone for most shots. The Pixel 4a does not have the latest engine, but it is still much faster and smoother than my old one. It doesn't have the largest battery, but for normal use battery life has been far better than on my old phone. One great feature of this phone was the easy transfer of files and apps from the old Pixel. I highly recommend this phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I splurged on myself and got this phone. Loved this phone so so much. The fingerprint reader is an amazing feature! Pictures are great just a little bloatware. But today at work I knocked it off my desk. Three feet high and it landed face down and the screen is shattered. I didn't throw it, not force was involved, it just fell off when I moved some papers. I've had plenty of cell phones and never have I cracked a screen. And, since it's a new model, the screen repair costs between $200-250. I didn't get the insurance because I've never needed it before. The case on it is a hard case with a slight lip coming over the screen for extra protection. Very disappointed in this product. It got two stars because it's a great phone, just a crappy screen. I recommend getting some insurance if you buy it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Took this to Verizon, they said it wouldn't work on their network..",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Nice fingerprint reader,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Been using this for a few weeks and so far am very happy. Replaced a Pixel XL that wouldn't stop randomly rebooting and getting confused about the battery level. It is smaller but I'm not really noticing that. Smaller fits my purse and pocket better. Battery life is awesome!! Great phone that doesn't break the bank. Love the slo mo on the camera.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Though I've only had this Pixel 4a a few days, it has been great so far. The phone came roughly 60% charged and, as far as I can see, didn't require any security updates right away. I was able to open the box and start set-up right away without waiting for charging. The instructions for set-up were good. The box has the cord thingy so you can easily transfer everything from your old Pixel phone to the new one in about 15 minutes or less. It also included a little tool thingy to help get the SIM card out. This was a nice and unexpected bonus that saved a lot of grief. The transfer of everything from the old Pixel to the 4a was smooth and didn’t take a ton of time; the most frustrating part is having to remember your google password, and any other passwords for apps you had on the previous phone. Also some settings needed to be readjusted. As of now, I don't seem to have lost anything, though 8 of my contacts transferred without the names. To clarify: the numbers were there in recent texts without a name attached to them but I was able to read the previous texts and determine whose number it was so I could add them as a new contact by using the 3 little vertical dot thingys on each text. I loved my flagship Pixel but knew I needed a new one because the old one wasn't being supported anymore and performance was getting slower. I chose the Pixel 4a largely due to the fact that the Pixels don't have all the bloatware that comes with Samsung and other brands. I don't use FB or Twitter or a lot of those other apps that take up space and not having these unneeded apps on my phone was a huge deal for me. I like having it be our choice whether to put an app on my phone rather than having these forced on us. I also like the Google Keep for notes and the Google Calendar since I had these on previous phones and everything transferred to this Pixel 4a smoothly. Another good factor is the price of the 4a (this was significant in our decision), particularly because it seems to have everything I need and not a bunch of stuff I don't need or want. An additional plus is the larger screen (no bezel) while still keeping the small size of the phone. The screen looks classy and it's small enough to not be a problem getting in and out of a pocket or purse. Everything is faster and smoother than the old Pixel. The plastic hardware isn't a big deal to me because I use a solid wallet-case for my phones so protection is provided & people don't see the outside of the phone anyway. There are a few nice, new 'bells and whistles' to learn if you are going from an older Pixel but they are good things and nothing to cause great frustration so far. I'm still struggling a little with the gesture thingy - and how to double-tap to get recently used apps to come up so we can close them all out. I liked the way we did it on the old Pixel better - but I am adjusting. I’m also noticing that the new camera seems to be saving 2 of every cameral shot (supposedly one is for editing) and this is annoying because they take up extra space and we rarely edit our photos, so we have to delete the duplicate almost every time. I sure hope Google photos fixes this issue soon. I’m hoping this review might help others who are considering an upgrade to the Pixel 4a. Overall, the upgrade from the flagship Pixel (or Pixel One, or whatever they call it now) appears to have been a good move.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is a great phone. Great battery life, very stylish and sturdy. I was hesitant to switch phone brands, but the features on this Pixel far outpace that of my last Iphone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I absolutely love this phone. I use my phone for basic things (tik tok, texting, calls, and streaming hulu/netflix) it has been perfect!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Worse photo management. Actually, non existent You must use Google photos which is cumbersome and hard to use. Camera is much worse than the reviews I read alleged. I bought this phone to run my online etsy store and hated it. Used it 10 days, could.not take it any more amd returned it. My LG V30 is a much superior camera phone. No comparison. I treated myself to a slightly upgraded V60 which also blows away the Pixel. There is not one feature on the Pixel that i thought was cool or wanted.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is a premium phone at a mid-level price. Great camera, fast processer, decent battery life, a sharp screen and no bloatware. The finger print sensor also works well. It is a small phone which I like but others may prefer a larger screen. If you can live without 5G this is a hard phone to beat.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I got this phone for my wife a month ago and she is loving it. She like how she have the ability to screen calls from unknown number and also to mess with the kids lls,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Awesome phone. I love what google has done with the new pixel. Normally I’m an iPhone gal and definitely don’t care for androids, but this google phone is top notch, especially for the unbeatable price. It has a great camera, superb battery life and many convenient features. Size is perfect and I added a case for protection. If you want an outstanding phone that doesn’t break the bank, get this one",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"First time using a pixel phone, previously used a samsung. I love the design, is easy to use and has amazing night view.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Everything works great but still trying to figure out all the features. I've used it for a few months but lately my bottom icons, on the home screen, keep shifting. And/or if I open up a different app it randomly will replace one of the home screen icons - like phone - which is becoming annoying. I don't know if I inadvertently changed a setting or if an update caused this shift. I will update this review if I figure it out",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The volume button stopped working,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My old iPhone SE died and i upgraded to the Pixel. It works, but I wish I would have bought the new SE instead. Battery life is good, camera is nice, it works as a smartphone, I like that it still has a headphone jack, but I expected more. The screen doesn't always respond (I try to expand from my home screen to view all apps, but it won't expand). I've already had to force restart it when it got stuck in an infinite startup loop (had it for only a month). I trained ""ok google"" for my voice, but it never works, however when I was listening to an audiobook in the car, for some reason the name ""Able"" activated google voice every time- super annoying. The first day, the alarm clock didn't go off (found out this is a known issue), and I was late for work. The top volume on the speaker is laughably quiet, so don't expect to be able to talk on speakerphone in the car. I can't seem to configure my work and personal stuff to be on the same screen (it forces me to segment them, so I have two gmail apps and two calendar apps - might be cool for some folks, but I don't like it). The fingerprint reader is on the back of the phone for your pointer finger, which isn't ergonomic at all. Google maps is slow to respond to route changes. I'm not a die hard Apple person, but I've found the iphone SE from years ago to be superior in nearly every way. In 2020 at this price point from Google, I expected more, now I'm stuck. I do not recommend this phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone! My old phone was slow and froze frequently within the first few months of having it, but the Pixel 4a has none of those problems! The camera is amazing, and has a lot of great settings and options. I will attach a regular picture and a portrait mode picture to show the clarity and great quality. The camera is also quickly accessable by double tapping the lock button on the side of the phone. I noticed that Google Duo has a share screen feature that is available on the Pixel 4a, but not a lot of other phones, and I enjoy having that option. The fingerprint reader works great. The battery lasts a very long time. I use my phone very frequently and usually charge it to 70 or 80% to preserve battery life. Even with all the usage, I usually only have to charge it once a day. It would definitely take a while to die with a full charge so no worries there. The thing I came across the most while researching the phone prior to purchasing was ""it's a great budget phone"" and I 100% agree. I'm no tech expert, but as a regular user, I can say this is the best phone I have ever had. In comparison with the Pixel 4 (which I do not have), the Pixel 4a does have a headphone jack, but does not have wireless charging or the squeeze feature, and is not water-resistant. I have the phone in ""Just Black"" and it is very nice and sleek with a white lock button. There were originally no navigation buttons and the phone directed me to use gestures but I was able to get the navigation buttons that I prefer in the settings. Overall it's a great phone and I highly recommend it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This has to be one of the best budget phones. It has all I need and a bit more. Yet, it didn't break the bank to buy. Good job Google!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Affordable. Fast processing. Good phone. Apple transfer and Verizon activation I switched from Apple w/o access to apple cloud (locked out). I was able to bring all gmail and google photos. Many gmail contacts had phone associated but not all. Verizon store charged $20 for SIM. And I paid $20 for transfer and activation assistance. Ship speed Amazon was accurate about ship time. But I wish it was a true 2 day prime delivery. Mine took 4 days.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I was using the Pixel 3 previously. Processing power-wise it was a down grade but bought this phone because my pixel 3 was starting to stutter at times and I just loved the way the display on the Pixel 4a looked. After receiving the phone - the phone felt really nice on the hands: outer plastic shell didn't feel cheap nor plasticky as many youtube reviewers stated(feels solid to me atleast). Also the curvature of the side well complimented the gesture navigation(going back gesture). - full display mode on youtube is awesome as expected(the bottom left punch hole is rarely noticeable due to its position in horizontal mode). Although the space between the top edge of the display and the status bar is quite noticable and would've been better if the gap was shorter. - also the display brightness seems slightly lower than the pixel 3 but nothing serious. - haptics feels identical to the Pixel 3 and happy that google did not cheap on this part. - apps not supporting the display ratio/size has a slim cutoff on the bottom of the display. Also, the status bar part is unutilised on all apps, which is a bummer but again not critical. - photo takes a split second more to process/save right after taking one, but besides this occasion I don't feel any noticeable processing speed difference on daily tasks compared to the Pixel 3(probably gaming will feel materially different but personally I don't game with my phone so no complaints on processing power). Overall, really enjoying the display and the design.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I've personally never used Android and honestly I'm not gonna be switching back to apple after seeing how wonderful this phone is. It's so nice and honestly the best phone I've ever had. You won't regret buying this phone!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Just received it. So far I love it. Lots of storage. Fastest phone I ever owned. Camera is awesome and fun to play with. Charges fast but gets warm while it charges which cud be a safety hazard maybe? Overall I'm impressed with my first Google phone verses Samsung. Get 3 years of updates so I will be keeping this phone for at least 3 years if not longer if I'm still happy with the phone. Not laggy like my old Samsung galaxy J7 was super slow at some tasks. This phone moves a lot faster than my old outdated phone. Thanks Google,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Coming from a budget phone that costed me $150 (Mi A2), this phone is such an obvious upgrade. The screen is beautiful, bright, and responsive, things that my old phone didn’t have. The camera far exceeds my expectations and is considered an extra feature for me. Included apps have safety features that aren’t present in any other phone. It’s such a magnificent device. The only gripe I have with this phone is it ships with Android 11, meaning NO OVERSCAN API!! Disgusting. Now I have to live with a big thick navigation bar. Other than that, everything else is fine. Will update in a few months if anything major happens with my new phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Pros: Photo quality better than most phone and even DC. Phone size is perfect. Processor is not top grade, but snappy in general usage. Battery life is acceptable for small phone. 3.5mm headphone jack really nice to have. Cons: Speaker not loud enough. Screen is good, but pixel density is not high enough for VR. Overall experience, great phone to buy.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The most impressive feature of this phone for me is the battery life. I had the previous Pixel 4 and didn't find it all that impressive. I think this is a much better design (even though the materials may not be as nice). For the price, it can't be beat!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"No user manual, not in the box, not online. It seems the only available information is on Google's Pixel Phone Help web page and on the phone itself. Both assume I know enough about what I don't know to search for it. According to one post, the rationale for limiting user information to online help is the rapid pace of change. That's what versioning is for: new release, new version of the manual. It's no more difficult than updating online help. Both formats are useful; each serves a different purpose. I may be wrong, but I suspect the company's refusal to produce a user manual is evidence of the disdain with which Google engineers view their user community. The attitude is not uncommon among software developers. I know whereof I speak; I am a software developer, though not for Google. And, yes, I returned the phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This not going be a technical review for this phone. Rather it's just my impressions about owning it. This phone is fantastic. I get two and a half days out of the battery but I also don't live on my phone. One of the great things is no bloatware, what a nice change. This phone basically set itself up, a bit of a letdown for someone who enjoys ""tinkering"" with things. I do like the fingerprint reader. If it will work on my fingers, it should work for anyone. Great camera, a first for me, settings I expect to find on my SLR not a phone. I really haven't got to try it but I will try to report what I think later on. I would DEFINITELY recommend a case but then I am a big believer in cases. Overall I would recommend this phone to anyone. Edit 02/13/21 So it's been a little over a month and my feelings about this phone haven't changed. The camera is fantastic. I'm still not going to get rid of the Nikon. It's nice for those moments when you say ""I wish I had a camera"". It seems I find a new feature every day. I would still recommend this to anyone who feels a 1000+ is a bit much for a phone",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pro: Good battery life, compatible with all the carriers, smaller size makes it easy to carry. Stock android makes it fast and smooth.

I've taken both video and still and am quite amazed like everyone else seems to say. Anyway, definitely one of the best phones you can buy at any price IMO.

"I typically buy a ""flagship"" phone every 3-4 years until the battery craps out. My last HTC10 went through 3 batteries before I finally cracked the screen and had to buy a new phone. I had been eyeballing the pixels for a while because they don't have all the carrier bloat and pre-loaded apps. I was pleasantly surprised to find this had just android with no third party apps burned into the rom. The setup was easy and pulled data from my old phone as well as all the updated versions of the apps from my old phone Battery life is just crazy. The phone came with about 60% charge. The included fast charger topped it off pretty fast. I wanted to condition the battery by running it way down before recharging a few times. I was kinda shocked that it took almost 3 days to get the phone down to <30% with my typical usage. Adaptive battery is on by default, and I typically have about 3 hours of screen time per day, and it hasn't had me searching for a charger once. This phone was advertised as having an all day battery and I'm sure it is true for heavy users. But for those that aren't on social media all day, this thing will be running for at least 2 days before you have to charge it. The battery life is just awesome. Also, in the first week my phone took 1 major and 2 minor updates which was nice. All my previous carrier phones would get at most 2 updates over their lives. This one gets them as soon as they are released.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I upgraded to Android 11. My camera can no longer be used normally. I can’t use the rear lens without dropping it on the ground or getting water. After turning the camera apps on, there is a black screen. I need to wait a few minutes to see the image. Even if I see the image, it is blurred and out of focus, and it will get stuck immediately. This makes me very bad for the pixel 4a. I think the core advantage of the pixel 4a as a cheap phone is that its camera function is comparable to flagship phones. But when I can no longer use its camera function, it loses its appeal to me. Can’t use the rear the lens is a problem even for daily use. I can't even scan the QR Code. I am quite disappointed with Google phones. I hope someone can help me solve the problem.

"I haven't bought a phone since my Samsung S5 Active, so I must admit to a little shock with this phone. It is so fast! I couldn't give a good review of the facial recognition as I haven't used it yet. After I have tried it and taken some pictures I will add to my review.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Do not buy this phone! As soon as the return window closed all kinds of issues arose with this phone. It started with over heating, then came the screen flickering (strobe light like), then came shutting the screen off all together until phone is restarted, now I'd say 30% of my touch screen is completely unresponsive and best part about that is each day it's new areas of the screen, parts that worked fine yesterday no longer work today but don't worry they will work great tomorrow. I've tried resetting to factory settings and all the other self fixes I can try. Even tried getting a warranty claim started on multiple occasions but good luck doing that when you can't use half your touch screen.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Really like the 4a. The phone is compact but very slim bezels give you almost all screen. Battery life is excellent. The display is great. The processor is very capable - I have no issues with any of the apps I use. I've had wireless charging in the past but I charge at night so plugging in is no big deal. It goes all day and I have half the battery left when I go to bed.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone for $$. Camera is very good. Sound clarity excellent. Wish it were waterproof. Upon further review this is the most irritating phone I've ever had. Whoever designed the swipe left back ""feature"" should be fired.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm really happy I waited and did my research and bought this phone! It works so well and it's really nice looking. Here are some things to note: 1) It can plug into your old phone and copy EVERYTHING over, which is so cool! And saves time. 2) Setup and customization is easy 3) I have TMobile and Wifi Calling works! Exactly what I need since I have bad service in my area 4) Get a screen protector and/or case because the screen is not gorilla glass. Be careful with it. 5) The battery can drain quickly unless you're in dark mode/battery saver. I like dark mode now. Buuut the charger that comes with the phone will charge it fully in less than an hour. I don't use fingerprints or facial recognition so I can't comment on that.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I got this to replace my aging Galaxy S7 and I have not been disappointed. This had just about everything I need. The size is very similar to the S7 which was welcomed with the trend of phones getting too big for one hand. It has a headphone jack, a rare feature to find these days 128GB of storage alot of space comes standard, which some phones charge extra for. Makes up for the lack of expandable storage The battery lasts just about all day with moderate to heavy use Amazing fingerprint reader, with masks and the unreliable nature of facial recognition it's nice having a sensor on the back which takes little to no effort to get to Usb c port (note Google uses a different fast charge system than Samsung and others which goes from the large usb A to usb c and instead uses one that goes from usb c to c) Excellent camera, on vacation I was asked by my girlfriend to take the pictures and send it to her since I ""have the better camera"" The only downsides I have (as someone who doesn't game on mobile) No wireless charging, not waterproof and the keyhole camera cut out takes some getting used to. But for the price I can forgive these shortfalls and there are water proof cases out there and even wireless charging adapters you can plug in and leave hidden behind your case",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
So the adaptive seems to work alright but eh could be better. I haven't figured out how face recognition works yet or even how to turn it on,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Initially the phone was exactly what I wanted. Used the phone for a few weeks then it got stuck in a reboot loop then software issues preventing me from backing up my info. So I contacted Amazon. because since the phone won't stay on long enough or I can't back up or erase my personal and important small business info from the phone I'm not comfortable sending it back.... Amazon won't issue me a refund without returning the phone. I'm not comfortable retuning the phone with my info and accounts open. I tried to explain this to several times to customer service and they told me to contact google. Called google from a different phone and Google customer service is closed because of covid restrictions. This is BS. So it's looking like I may be stuck with a $350 paperweight.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I am not a game enthusiast person. Not even a single game is installed in my phone So for all my other office work, podcast work, editing etc this phone is very good. no doubt that for this much price a good phone has been release after a long time by Google. Only complaint I can say is when I opened my phone, after setup I could see it was charged 67% and under battery settings I could see it was charged to full battery 14hr before it was delivered to me. This leads to suspicion that box was unboxed and tested before sending to me. Not sure if this has any flaw about battery as the phone gets heated up very quickly. cons: heats up quickly",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

had to changed my review. this phone is not that great and not really anything special,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"While I work in the space of mobile applications I tend to hold off on upgrading my phone until the last minute of my phone's life. Upgrading to this from the OG Pixel was a great transition. There were things about the other Pixel phones that I didn't like so I waited until one had what I needed. Headphone jack, thank goodness. I'm old and still love having this as an option because I have older equipment here and there that it's just a lot easier. Fingerprint reader on the back of the phone again; this is one thing that the OG Pixel had that I really loved. It became second nature so I really wanted it back. The battery life on this phone is fantastic so far. I would say with moderate use I could probably get 2 days out of it on a charge. It also charges fairly quickly. For performance, it does exceptionally well for the price range and it's all I need. The camera takes pretty great pictures, and does well with portrait mode even better than the iPhone SE. (It recognizes my dog so I'm happy haha). The only downsides to this phone for me would be no wireless charging and it is not 5G ready. I knew this going into it and honestly I can't live without those things for another couple of iterations. The phone is very intuitive and a great experience.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I switched from a Samsung Galaxy and I couldn't be happier. The price, the durability, the size, and the available apps are all exactly what I wanted. I don't need a phone so big it's uncomfortable to carry in my pocket and I simply see no value in a 5G phone right now. Google hit it out of the park with this phone and at less than half the cost of a flagship phone, I'm amazed I don't see more people carrying a 4. The lack of wireless charging and the less than outstanding battery life is a drawback but that's the price you pay for not going flagship. I keep a charging cord at my desk and as long as you don't need to go without for more than a business day, there's really no problem.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I have always had expensive iPhones (over $1 K), but now that I am retired I cannot afford that kind of money for a phone. I am also totally SICK of Apple, as their security on phones and iCloud is so extreme and bizarre that I have wasted many hours on their help line. Did you know that if Apple mistakingly thinks you are in Hong Kong, they will change your entire phone to traditional Chinese? That took me 5 hours on the phone to rectify. And puzzles me ... even if I WAS suddenly in Hong Kong, I would NOT suddenly start reading and speaking in traditional Chinese. In any event, I could not take the stress any more, so I decided to take the BIG step of divorcing Apple and moving to Android. I expected to have a big learning curve, but I just watched a few YouTube videos, and the transition was seamless. Within 24 hours I was IN LOVE with this phone. The screen is gorgeous, the speed is more than good enough, the battery life is awesome, and the apps are marvelous. It can do EVERYTHING my iPhones used to do. The difference is that downloading my photos to my computer is easy and a sheer pleasure. I NEVER get locked out because, for example, I have travelled to Mexico and suddenly Apple is suspicious of me. Oh, and the camera is super important to me. That is why, after a lot of research, I chose this particular phone. Well, the camera is outstandingly excellent. I am thrilled about the astral photography. For a third of the price I paid for my iPhone 6, I now have a camera that is about 3x better. I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone - the best one I have ever had in my life. And this is coming from someone who has had decades of flagship phones from Apple. I feel sorry for all those who still think that nothing but an iPhone would do. I would rather go back to pay phones than ever own an iPhone again.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Got rid of my Samsung Note 10 that was only a year old for the Pixel 4a. The Note 10 wouldn't charge and Samsung wouldn't fix without sending it back to the factory. It was a common problem with that phone. The Google Pixel does everything I need and very easy to use and set up. The price for it is awesome as well.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I used this phone for about 2 weeks and constantly was dropped from data. This made the phone essentially useless since several times I could not make a phone call in the middle of town with great reception. I took it in to AT&T and they got it to work in the store. 5 minutes later it was the same thing. I got so frustrated that I gave up. Nothing like buying a new phone and being excited about it and then not having it work most of the time.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I gave this 3 stats because of the software. I felt like google could've done a better job especially since this is a pure android device. The notification system is stupid. When someone text me and I respond to it from the notification window the text remains there in the notifications. If I'm the last person to respond why do I need to see my own .message in the notifications?? That's stupid! If I respond the notification needs to go away! If get a bunch of notifications (emails, text) and I swipe them away, more notifications show up IMMEDIATELY. Sometimes they aren't even new. I literally have to press ""clear all"" 3x for the notifications to go away. I also don't like that if I'm on a website that I'm trying to upload a image to, the phone sends you on a wild goose chase to find your ""gallery"". By default it brings up ""recent images"" and I think that's dumb. You should be able to choose what it defaults to. Even still when you press on ""camera"" it'll still take you to another screen that you have to press ""camera"" again just to get to the images you took with your camera. These things can be fixed with software but it's super annoying, especiy the notifications. Not to mention I bought a fossil smart watch that runs wear OS and if I check a email from last year, the watch will send me a notification from that email like I just received it! STUPID! FIX THIS STUFF GOOGLE! Battery is ok considering this is a mid level phone. Kinda get what you pay for on that one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"pros: Great phone light fast awesome camera simple Cons: Some days the battery life can be an issue, but this is mostly remedied by the fact that the phone takes nothing to charge, and that it completely depends on usage. Learning curve going from samsung to google's interface I find it interesting that this phone has bridged the understanding gap of how i-phone's UI works for an android user. The battery life is hit or miss depending on your usage, on heavy days, I will have to charge by afternoon, but on days I barely look at my phone, it seems to last over 24hrs.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Amazing camera,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've looked up so much reviews on this phone and this is the greatest phone I've ever had. It's only been my first day with it, so there's still much to understand about it. This device was able to scan all my songs in seconds compared to my last phone. The camera can see much better than what the eye can see when it comes to lighting. The speed of this phone is unlike any other at products at this pricing. Just don't expect this to be a high end gaming device or a and hd video recorder with high frame rate. Otherwise, If you need a taste of the greatest smart phone experience and not having much on your budget and no need of crazy all the expensive unwanted features, this phone is a must.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"*If you don't want to read my entire review, here is the summary: The Google Pixel 4a is the BEST phone you can buy right now for almost everyone. For $349 it's a NO BRAINER.* I have used several Android phones (including flagship ones that cost $900+) and I've also used an iPhone. But this Pixel 4a is the absolute best overall experience I've ever had with any phone. I'm a tech guy for a living, so I needed a phone that could do everything and do it well, this phone more than delivered! Did I mention it's ONLY $349? Below is a pros and cons list I've made for potential buyers. I hope you find it helpful! Pros: Fully unlocked so it will work with EVERY SINGLE carrier in the USA (As well as many outside the US), HUGE amount of built in storage of 128GB, plenty of RAM at 6GB, a fast and energy efficient processor (SD 730G), a bright and beautiful 5.8 inch display (OLED at 1080p+ resolution), a headphone jack! (For those of us who still prefer a wired connection), a decent sized battery (3100+ mah) that gives you all day battery with moderate to heavy use, fast charging included in the box (18W) you get from empty to 100% in about an hour and a half, with close to 50% after 20 mins give or take, dual stereo speakers that sound great, a very good hapitic feedback engine when you type, a phenomenal front and rear camera (literally the best camera on any Android phone), really premium feeling polycarbonate (plastic) body, really sturdy and clicky buttons, and the absolute best software experience by Google with at least 3 major Android OS upgrades in the future. Cons: No water or dust proofing, no wireless charging, only available in Just Black color, no 5G support, limited case selection (As of right now but that will change in the future). Overall, the experience of using this phone is fast, fluid, and enjoyable. The screen is bright and almost edge to edge, it's the perfect size for one handed use, the Pixel version of Android is light and easy to use and has many really good exclusive features like ""Now playing"" and ""Live transcribe"" as well as many more new features to come with the newest version of Android and security patches being pushed out directly from Google to their Pixel line of phones. It offers unmatched support and longevity for Android updates and security patches. I've had this phone for several days and it's my daily driver, I have had no issues or complaints with it at all. The battery life is great, it's super fast and smooth, it doesn't slow down or stutter when I use multiple apps at a time, it doesn't close my apps down in the background too quickly, and it's the perfect size for my hands and pockets. What else can I say? You don't need to spend $900+ to get a really good phone! Just spend $349 and get this phone! You won't regret it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've used this phone for a full day. The cameras are fantastic, the display is good (but small for my taste). Haven't used the battery too much (+ the google battery AI hasn't been trained yet), so can't judge on that. The extra RAM here is great -- I went through my social media, then went back to a heavy game (GTA SA) and it was surprisingly still in memory! I've noticed the phone gets really hot throughout the day, especially when you're charging and using it for video calls. The phone even said that it would start disabling features due to overheating. So maybe avoid charging the phone and using it. That's the only bummer I've had with this phone -- that aside, this is a fantastic budget phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Oh my goodness!! This is the worst phone ever!! I'm still trying to figure everything out after 7 days of using it! Nothing is easy and actually at this time I can't get it to show me all of my apps, which it did yesterday but not today!! Don't buy!!!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It has been a long wait, as my old Pixel continued to deteriorate, but glad that I was able to upgrade to now my favorite Android phone. The Pixel 4a is amazing, the colors are a little bit different than my old Pixel, but I know I had the same situation when I was moving from my Nexus 5x. This phone is beautiful and with multiple applications open, it's fast and smooth. I'm using the eSim with T-Mobile and that works great. I have spent a couple hours using it and really no complains, it's light, but not flimsy and my Spigen Hybrid case doesn't add much to it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
A couple reviews cited how cheap and plastic the phone felt or how the fingerprint scanner didn't work. I can say it feels just fine to me and the fingerprint scanner has worked everytime. I think you need to adjust your expectations when buying a $349 phone. Same thing with the lag on viewing of photos...that wasn't an issue for me. My only complaint so far is the battery life isn't as great as I expected. Still far an away better than my old phone. modified after using the phone for one week: the battery life is really bad. I docked it a star for that. I don't really use it that much and still it's dead by the end of the day. I'm testing out the extreme battery saver mode but that solution seems a bit....extreme.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Got this phone over two weeks ago. First time getting a Google phone. VERY Disappointed. Flipping through phone options is slow and delayed, when the phone rings while texting the screen goes black and makes it impossible to actually take the call. Touch is way to sensitive making it hard to actually hold the phone in your hand without dialing/typing.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Bought this phone for T-Mobile and had zero issues swapping over to the phone from my old phone. Phone has almost all the features I cared about such as unlockable bootloader and headphone jack. The main this phone doesn't have that would be nice is an SD card slot. Wireless charging and LED notification light would have been nice also but over all its a budget phone with specs that can rival even some flagship phones for less then half the price so its to be expected it wouldn't have all the bells and whistles.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I dropped my Pixel 2 and had to replace it. The more I looked, the more it came down to this one and an old model iPhone. I'm really happy with this phone: battery like is very good and liking the utility. I'm not a ""heavy"" user as I'm not on my phone constantly, but it does the job I need doing. There are some new gestures, which took a short time to get used to and haven't been a problem since the first week or two.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Really a great phone for most people ! It doesn't have the most features in the world, but almost everything you really need. Great camera and fast in the apps. Battery life got better after 2 weeks when the phone get to know your usage patterns on apps. The battery last about 6-7 hours on screen on time if you use it mostly indoors with wifi and less brightness than you would be needing outdoors. -Minus: For no water resistance and no wireless charging, but for the price it is ok and understandable.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Very sleek and clean.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought this on a whim after using various Galaxy phones since 2013. Being very adjusted to that version of Android OS that Galaxy uses, it's weird at first to see Google's take on an Android OS but after only about an hour or two, it's pretty convenient in this phone. My least favorite part about getting a new phone is transferring all my previous data to a new device, but Android to Android makes this process so streamlined, I had all my music, photos, apps, wallpapers, and smaller settings in about 15 minutes from when I first booted the phone up. A few things I think that makes this device stand out is that it's like an iPhone XS with an Android OS running it. The display is clear and sharp, the touch is consistent, the camera is superb for the price that you pay, and the software is rather simple and clean to use. If you're concerned about the punch-out camera in the top left of the screen like I was, don't worry. It's barely noticeable when using the device like normal. This phone's size is pretty comfortable when it comes to one handed use. The matte finish on the back side gives the device a nice feel when it's being used. So far, I really like my Pixel 4a and I'm happy I jumped ship. If you're someone who wants a phone for more basic tasks while being streamlined, then pick this up and give it a go, you won't be disappointed.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"So I have had zero issues with the fingerprint reader. It is actually been really good for letting me in and nobody else in. I even put a case on mine and I can still reach the finger reader so I actually think it's really great it's much easier for me to get into my phone compared to my old one. What I like about this phone too is that it is thinner. I used to have the Moto x charge and that was definitely much wider and I didn't realize how much more uncomfortable it is. Now when I pick that one up to try and compare to this one it's such a beast in such a tank. Whereas this new phone it's thinner and slimmer and can actually like fit in my palm so it's in my hand and then it can sit nicely on my finger like if I'm holding it like cut. Which is very nice and I can reach everything on it with my thumb. The fact that the screen is the entire phone face is still giving me the exact same size as my old phone just I no longer have a big phone because it didn't take up the whole screen it had sides on it before so I really like that this one is the whole screen and that it's slimmer. I have a nice case on it and I have a screen protector on the front and I'm still able to use everything the same and everything is functioning fine. My only thing is yes the battery does last all day, my old phone my battery could last a couple days but it was an ex-charge and the battery was supposed to do that. But the bonus about this phone here is it does tell me if I keep continuing using it at the rate that I am it tells me about when my phone will die the estimated die time for the battery. So that's easy for me to be like oh okay well I'm going to be going and doing this so maybe I should charge it now. But I typically only charge it at night when I'm going to sleep. it does have a spam detection for calls which I didn't realize was a thing and I've had a couple phone calls like pop up but never ring and then they go away and I am notified that they were spam and then I have verified and they actually are indeed spam. So that has been really nice. I also like that I can give names to my group chats. Everything seems to be running very smoothly and fast at least faster than what I'm used to. it did take a little getting used to for me to do the back button cuz there was no back button I couldn't figure it out but if you just hold off to the side a little bit it is actually much easier to go back and forth between things I've found. my screen now has five icons across compared to my old one that had only four icons across so for me that's fine because I can see them fine I haven't looked to see if I can change that. So if you are maybe hard on seeing that might not be a benefit but otherwise for me since I don't have that problem this is great I really also like that I can just click on the time and date on the phone and it pulls up my calendar or the weather I don't have to go search for a different app I just click on it on my phone and it just takes me to that app. my other favorite thing is that it is still an Android phone I absolutely love the Android app I even have my tablets in Android because I'm just so used to Android and I prefer Android over the counterpart. Like I really dislike Apple and Apple I think is so much more expensive. another fun thing is the night mode I set a bedtime for me and when it's my bedtime if I'm staying up it goes into a black and white scale mode so everything is in black and white so then I go all right fine yep it's bedtime. I also like the do not disturb because I can have things blocked for when I'm sleeping so my phone isn't ringing or anything and I don't have to remember to put it on silent it was automatically does that. Unless of course it's emergency it is set to if somebody calls back within a 10-15 minute window that it will ring because it's a priority call and I have that turned on. I haven't even come close to using all the storage space that I have on my phone. Whereas my old phone I was constantly having to delete things to get a new app if I wanted to and it was very hard to do, so I like the extra space I like how fast it works and I like the thinness of it actually. As for phone calls and stuff I don't have an issue with the speaker or the earpiece very simple to use and my camera is still working nicely I I still get really nice pictures. this one does say that it's for all carriers and I have Xfinity mobile, and when I got the phone I checked the number against their oh is your phone compatible on the website and it wasn't. I was very frustrated I even set up to start a new return with this but then, I was on with the people on chat and I was trying to figure it out and I even said I was going to try and go somewhere else. But here's the thing even though that they wouldn't help me and they kind of have some sucky customer service. I have a very cheap bill with them I just have to have my cable with them to get them and then each month it's just I think it's like $12 per gigabyte of data that you use and since I don't use data I don't have a bill each month because my phone is paid off I have nothing else going on there so I have a really great deal with them so I want to keep with them so. So before I decided to actually ship it back I pulled my chip card out of my old phone and slid it into this one here and eureka! My phone actually works really well I didn't have to change anything with my carrier all I had to do was change my SIM card and the phone is compatible even if they tell you it's not compatible So I would say give that a try if you do have Xfinity, and then if it works great if not I'm sorry you'll have to look for something else considering the stage shouldn't work but mine works and I've been doing it for two months now and haven't had any disruptions with my service everything has been great and I haven't had to change my billing at all so I have really enjoyed having this phone.

I got my phone in before the expected delivery date. So far the phone is running as expected. I am glad you're able to use a esim with a normal nano sim card. I am using straight talk as my primary service provider and using google fi on the esim. I wanted to see if the service is better with google fi or should I stay with straight talk.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've had it for a month and it quit reading my sim card. I went to my provider and tried a new sim card and an esim with no luck. I am 2 days past the return policy so I guess I gatta count my losses on this one. Also if you plug a aux cord and/or headphones into the aux port it's super quiet and can barely hear anything. UPDATE: I got in contact with google and the phone was under warranty so I got to send it in for free repairs. Well they said it would cost to much to fix so I got a certified used phone in return at no extra cost. Well I am still having the same sound issue with the new phone. the AUX port doesn't work. It is super quite, for 2 phones in a row to do this is not a coincidence. The sound is god awful with these phones DO NOT BUY ONE IF YOU LIKE MUSIC.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Love my Pixel so far. Battery life is the best I've ever experienced.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is a great phone. I moved from an Essential PH-1 because of a few issues there. I was afraid I'd miss the nicer materials, but that's simply not the case. Everything here is fast and solid. The screen is great. The sensors are fast. The battery lasts longer than all day. So good!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I've had this Pixel 4a for about 3 weeks. It's been excellent so far. The transfer of data was really cool and easy. I moved the SIM card from my old phone to my new phone took just a matter of a few minutes for it to start working. There was a problem with the SIM card manager but that was resolved by restoring to the previous version of the SIM card manager app. I'm very happy with the smaller size of the phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Another great pixel phone! Lightweight with a great battery and camera. This one have full screen upfront and very thin. Great phone!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone, high quality, and best price! BEST CAMERA EVER!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have only had this phone for a few days and it is pretty good so far. The only problem I have that stands out is the battery life for this phone is terrible. I went from a 2 or 3 year old moto 5g plus and even that older phone has better battery life than this. Ill have to test out the phone some more, but its instantly apparent that the battery sucks.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Love this phone!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Just got it today, put the sim in and was ready to go has a great OLED display and love the Google features. It's a 350 dollar phone obviously it's going to missing some features that a higher end phone would have.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Camera is one of the best out there. Speakers sound better than any phone I've had since the nexus 6p. AMOLED display and 128gb storage at this price is great. ""Budget"" processor is fast enough, phone hasn't seemed slow in any regular scenario. Battery life is decent, can make it a full day no problem. Only gripe is it comes set to gesture controls out the box and the ""back"" gesture is always conflicting with app's right swipe. Had to revert to 3 button interface.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I got this to replace an aging Note 5, which itself was a replacement for a Nexus 5. I never quite felt like the Samsung version of android was something I enjoyed, and I was looking forward to returning to the stock experience I had with the N5, and this one fit the bill. Sure, it doesn't have a few features I was hoping it had, but the honest truth is...did I really need them? For the price ($350 at the time of this review) there simply isn't anything remotely close in my opinion, and I am truly enjoying the experience with this. The fingerprint reader is just practically instant, and the placement on the back is the right place for it. I always hated the Samsung's button fingerprint reader, and it seemed like a crap-shoot whether it would work or not. this one is just darn solid. Camera is great, and the battery life is just unbelievable. Unless you -absolutely- need some of the missing features, like the wireless charging, wide-angle camera or the faster-refresh rate, then this is the one to get. If you do feel like you need those, do make sure you ask yourself if they are worth paying over 2x the cost of this phone for them... This isn't just a great phone for $350, it is a great phone full stop, and if this is the feature set and performance I can now expect at this price point, I will never shell out $1k+ for a phone ever again. I didn't get it through amazon as it was sold out, but I also got the google branded case and that one is also fantastic and highly recommended. I just love that feel of the cloth-like texture and wish I could get something like that for my iPad. And it is washable!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I love this lil phone. I was about to send it back before in I discovered that you can increase the size of objects in on the screen in Accessibility. I was looking in the Display section of the settings. The camera on is truly amazing.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was extremely torn between this phone and the Moto G Power (2020 version). They are both great phones without bloatware, and top of their relative classes, but I'm very happy I paid more for the Pixel 4a. It's smaller, lighter, way better camera, better hardware, more software/security updates, and I prefer Google apps anyway. It has more features than I'll use, but not a ridiculous amount like on the Samsung Galaxy S4 I had years ago. I was nervous about battery life, just because I'm used to having a phone with a ridiculous battery, but there are so many settings that extend your battery life on this phone. There's a battery saver mode AND an extreme battery saver mode! I want this phone to last as many years as possible, so I use the extreme mode all the time time. I don't have to charge it but once every 1-3 days. If I used the phone more I would probably have to charge it once a day. I like I can unpause specific apps, while leaving the rest in battery save mode. I was nervous about buying a used (not renewed) phone on Amazon, especially because the one I purchased was only considered in ""good condition, with minor scratches on front, back, and sides"". The phone I received is nearly flawless! I actually didn't notice the incredibly minute scratches on the left side, and bottom right corner of the screen for at least 30 minutes out of the box. They're so small I thought they were dust. There are no marks on the back or sides at all. I couldn't be happier with this phone and I'm so glad I saved some money buying it used. I can't speak for longevity, but my bank gives me a 2yr warranty past a phone's release date, and the Pixel only came out Aug 2020. Seriously get this phone if you like smaller phones, if you need a cheaper phone, I would get the Moto G Power(2020 version only!) in a heartbeat.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I went from a Xiaomi Mi A2 lite, after 3 generations of Samsungs, as they lost value per dollar. The Xiaomi was a much better value and also very comfortable, but the problem with all chinese phones: They don't support all U.S. cell bands! I had service 60% of the time, and never when inside a big building. THE PIXEL?!? Instantly felt comfortable, very lightweight, the perfect size with a big, beautiful OLED screen, very convenient fingerprint sensor with fast unlock, very fluid animations. Oh and the BEST phone camera that AI sharpens and makes pictures look so true to life. It also comes with Android 11, which has some neat features, such as adaptive charging so it charges slowly to save your battery while being full your morning alarm goes off. cons: smaller battery, still says 1day 6 hours on full. plastic backing, but I put a case on it anyway. So far, been very impressed and think the Pixel is the best Android experience there is.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Well behaved, little bloatware. Missing nothing of importance.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Good phone, good value. Plenty of memory, but wish they added SD slot for more memory.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is my first pixel and I really want to love it. It seems like a solid phone with all the stuff I need, until the microphone stopped working after 2 weeks. When on the phone, I can only be heard over speaker. After doing some troubleshooting following google instructions, it is determined a microphone issue. Seems like there are some pixel users with microphone problems. I could have brought the phone to an authorized repair shop to have it fixed for free, but I contacted Amazon costumer service first. The representative tried to connect me with a google representative, but was unsuccessful. So it got a replacement. So far the replacement works well.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Love the phone but the left speaker kinda sucks. Bit of a rattle when people are talking, seems they tried to get more base out of the driver than they can handle or their manufacturing process sucks and allows the driver to vibrate. Thought about RMAing the phone but that would be a hassle and this seems to be a common issue with these phones.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great value, price, battery life, camera, stock Android experience. Exclusive Google's features and app. Best Android experience.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
No doubt in my mind like the product.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I bought used from Amazon. Wont work with T-Mobile Network. They sent me 2 different SIM cards and I wasted over an hour on the phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've had this phone for a couple months now and absolutely love it! There's only one MAJOR problem and it's been happening since the phone was first purchased. That detail leads me to believe it's a manufacturing defects. As soon as I dial a number, the screen turns black and won't turn back on, no matter what I do. I can't use the side button to power it down because I can't use the screen and I can't end phone calls, etc. I have to wait for to other party to answer and hang up, or let the voicemail timeout and hangup on me. It's frustrating, especially when dealing with automatic robo-operators..",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Cons: - The Panorama mode is terrible. You can't go up and down, to take a photo of a tall tree, for example. - You cannot do a side scrolling panorama, for example, take a photo of a long shelf to see everything along the length of it. You MUST stay still and tilt for it to attempt a photo - The phone lags and glitches often when deleting a photo or switching from camera mode to video mode - Google Photos is the only app that comes installed for viewing/managing photos; there is no other image gallery Also - Google just updated app icons so they all look similar to each other and very different from what they were, making everything Google less accessible, more difficult to find. No settings to change app icons back to old version. No setting to change the battery icon to say percentage - hard to read the tiny battery symbol Pros - - regular camera is fine, night mode is cool I guess - not having bloat ware, having control over what apps I have or don't have is nice. No more NFL or Facebook stuck on my phone - phone speaker volume is very good for receiving calls Overall feeling pretty blah and annoyed with it. Maybe it would be better if they changed the camera related software. Is it too late to return this? Booooo thumbs down.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"For 3 years I had been waiting for Motorola to come out with a suitable replacement for my old, cracked screen Moto G5 Plus. I waited in vain. All that were available in the US were gimmicky phones like the stylus. And they got ever larger too. The Pixel 4a is just right. It fits comfortably in my hand. It's feels lighter than my Moto. The on/off button is located high on the right side where it is out of the way -- I don't press it every time I pick up the phone. The fingerprint reader is located on the back where it can be operated one-handed, also out of the way so it is not triggered every time I touch the bottom of the screen. There is only an occasional problem with fingerprint recognition, not enough to complain about. I think they got the basic ergonomics right. The phone screen itself is bright enough to see outside. The calls are clear and volume is good. The screen is sharp. I have no problems getting a couple days regular usage from the battery. The processor feels fast -- I don't have to wait for apps to respond to input. All in all I'm very satisfied with this phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I like the phone so far. Only been using for a week. Very easy to transfer apps and data from older phone. Had no trouble setting up with Visible. Battery life pretty good. Perfect size phone for my liking.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I bought this to replace an older iPhone. I was a bit worried about transferring all my information from one opening system to the other but, using the provided cable, it was effortless and took just a few minutes. I’m finding the controls and settings to be easy to operate. The only complaint I have is the buttons are set too low on the right edge and hard to avoid when holding the phone. Minor problem. I picked this phone because of the excellent camera and the good price. I’m very happy with it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
A recommendation from a friend this phone fits perfectly in my smaller hand and user friendly.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It is disappointing because I really enjoyed the phone and its set up but after only 2 months of normal use, I dropped it - with a case and screen protector from only 30""- it completely shocked the inside. I'm aware that this is a bargain phone because it's so cheap but to me, this is unacceptable in a smartphone. My iPhone 7 before this lasted for 3 years without a case and dropping it many times from taller heights without any issue. Clearly poorly made. In addition, Google was not helpful and said they would not pay the $130 to fix it. Poor customer service - never had any experience like this with Apple. I attached pictures of how the phone looks (only took the case off for the picture)",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Very good phone for the price. Also quick for multitasking. Fingerprint is spot on. I have had very good experiences with google products.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Good phone. Recommended,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I can't understand why phones are getting so large, approaching mini tablets I need something that fits in my hand and pocket and this works great for that Software and all the programs run smoothly, the camera is impressive especially considering it's a single lens and the Unicorn Beetle case I got for it pairs nicely Can't speak to the transfer process from other phones with the included cables since I prefer to start fresh with new phones, but it was a nice addition I hadn't gotten with other devices May update in a few months if I have other relevant/useful thoughts",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is absolutely perfect. I used to have an iPhone until I got the 3a last year. I was hooked. Now they took what made the 3a amazing and perfected the it this time with the full screen display. Impressed with how Google focused on the important things like camera, smart OS, headphone jack, buttery smooth functionality, finger sensor, and simplicity. Plus its really smart. Satisfied with how they mastered the necessary things and dropped the frivolous features like wireless charging, waterproof, face ID and glass body on the 4a. The camera alone is worth $350. Seriously, go watch reviews. It is absolutely mind-blowing how great this phone is for the price. I highly recommend it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is my first time with a modern phone, so I'm in ""learning mode"" to get familiar with the things I can do with this phone. But, so far, everything seems to be working smoothly and everything I wanted to do with the phone is available.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I like this phone for 1) up-to-date OS 2) its not huge (its about the same size as the Moto G5 plus it replaced, but the screen is larger because the bezels are smaller) 3)responsive 4)Transferring apps/settings/files from my previous android phone was easy; came with a USB connector for this purpose 5)The OS is starting to incorporate some of the better windows phone features. Note the time displayed when the phone is idle in the photo. Also, when the phone wakes up, you go directly to your home screen. No more wake swipe-swipe to get to something. Cons: gesture navigation is a mixed bag. I like having more screen real estate, but the back swipe interferes with in-app navigation. Bluetooth still seems to be a mess, you still can't easily put a shortcut to connect to just one specific device. Other: For me, the battery can last two days with light use, with typical use I'm maybe down to 33% at the end of the day.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Haven't seen a good smartphone, fairly priced, all-rounder, since the Moto Z Play. I don't really miss SD cards because they simply suck, and honestly I can't even remember the last time I used one for something that wasn't a PinePhone. Straight up installed Graphene OS for what, I hope, should be obvious reasons. The camera is pretty good even without the Google Camera, I have been using Open Camera with the camera2 API. The battery, while not amazing, is enough for one day and a bit with medium usage (but do keep on mind I'm not using the stock ROM!). Camera bumps are annoying, but I can't really complain, since there's only so much you can fit in a smartphone. Thanks for keeping the headphone jack, the quality is average, but definitely not bad. Snappy, of course, I don't really know why are smartphones getting so expensive and absurd with the hardware. Very fast and accurate fingerprint reader.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I purchased the phone based on online reviews by pundits and users. The camera was rated great - check, all day battery life - check, great screen - check, Android without the bloatware - check. Everything was great except it didn't fit my big hands. It felt awkward and too small for me to hold until I received the phone case I ordered later than the phone purchase. Adding the phone case made holding the phone acceptable, however, there was still one thing I missed that I had on my last phone and that is a larger screen. I'm 60 and now need to use reading glasses so a larger screen on my aging eyes is a definite must for me. If you have smaller hands and don't mind a small screen this is a great device. And if you have big hands then it may not fit for you. My suggestion is to go to the store and hold a Pixel a4 or a phone the same size to see if it feels okay in your hand. If it fits then you can't go wrong with this phone. With that said I am sad to say that I returned it for a Samsung A71 which has a much larger screen and is rated great also.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I was worried about the phone being too big after holding on to my old 4.8 inch phone for dear life. The width isn't much bigger and it is slim so it fits with a pop socket for one handed texting. Set up was really easy and seamless going from my old iphone. Great picture quality. It has its own charger style (not Android or iPhone) so I plan to buy an extra cord for on the go. Battery life is insane and I love the fingerprint on the back. I haven't dived into facial recognition yet. I'm ecstatic at the phone for the price point. Also really excited to have a match for my Google home mini!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone came earlier than expected. It was easy to set up. It is a little narrower than my old phone so it is easier to grip. Took photos and love the quality of them; they are so much sharper than the ones I took with my old phone. Just for the camera, I think this is an excellent phone for the price!!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"As someone who has always only been on the snapdragon 600 line series (I'm extremely cheap and poor both ok!) due to the below 200 price point, this phone is an absolute godsend. I had no idea how much of a different 6gb ram and a 730g could make over moto power g (2020) specs. Had initially bought a renewed one and had to return it due to a sim tray missing (how'd amazon refurbished miss this!!), a warm screen and phone getting hot. tbh, i realized the screen wasn't a defect and just how google intended :( Was actually plannign to return this too but recently I've been returning too many items partially due to losing my savings and miscell reasons here and there. I didn't realize the return policy wasn't intended to be used for try and buy purposes so I am scared of being flagged for too much activity so I'll have to jsut use this :( . Anyways! on to the phone! Like i said, I've only just started using it despite holding it for a week cus i was scared of it getting damage or antyhing. I'm starting to get used to the warm display (samsung, OP and moto users bewarned!) and THANK GOD the phone heating up was a renewed phone issue. phone is snappy as well and while i have a few issues with android 11, thy're nothing to do with the phonne's hardware.

"UPDATE: Google released another update which fixed the touchscreen issue. ORIGINAL: Loved the phone until the Android 11 update. Now, with a screen protector installed, the touchscreen is too sensitive and the phone is unusable. Works ok without the screen protector, but that risks permanent damage to the screen. It's a known issue and Google had had weeks to fix it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Imported this phone to the UK and I am not disappointed. An excellent phone, with fantastic features.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I came from a Galaxy S8 which unfortunately had a quite badly damaged screen. Google has dropped the ball on a couple of what I consider crucial features (No separate ringtone and notification volume? Seriously?) but I have hopes they will rectify them in the coming updates. For the price, it is a nicely rugged phone that isn't a six sided piece of glass just waiting to shatter. The battery life is also insane! It lasts all day and then some with moderate use. I highly recommend looking into the Pixel series if you are fed up with Samsung.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Love it!.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Lots of screen issues. Poor sensitivity in areas, ended up with some faulty hardware (pressure issue) while phone was a month old (no outward signs of damage) that turned the screen splotchy colors. Also poor durability- Dropped the phone a couple weeks after the screen was replaced under warranty, and it completely popped off and shattered underneath the screen protector. Will cost about $200 to replace the screen. I have loved my original Pixel in the past, but I will be going back to an older version after using the 4a for 2 months.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"So I was slightly skeptical about this phone. Some of the reviews worried me a bit. I did a month worth of research on finding the perfect budget phone for myself. Everything was pointing to the pixel 4a. I unfortunately didn't do enough research with my last phone which was the moto g7. I absolutely loved the g5 and just assumed I would love that one as well, and no I didn't. So this was like a really nice upgrade for me. I usually use a phone for at least 2 years and couldn't get past a year with that one. So I'm a heavy phone user from streaming, games here and there, camera and social media. I'm not some tech genius but I do my research. Let me tell you some things I love about this phone. Standout Pros- - The price! -The camera, it's absolutely fantastic. I can't get over how much I love it. My photos on my old phone were terrible. Now I can't stop taking pics. - Minimal bloatware. Not a whole lot is preloaded onto this phone which is great. - How light it is. Old phone was so heavy my hand would fall asleep. This is a great weight. -The features, I love some of the great things this phone can do. Such as the picking up of music around you. There are a bunch of things I really enjoy but just go watch a good review on youtube if you want to see them all. Cons- -Extremely crappy case selection lol. Literally that's the only con I have so far and it's a small one. Although I do have to say that everyone was raving about the pixel 4a's battery life. And I have to say it's pretty good. It's about the same as my old phone. It's not insane as I thought it was going to be. It's not a con because it's not bad in any way. Just thought I would mention it's not as mind blowing as it was made out to be. Also I thought I'd mention that my old phone had a 6.2 inch screen and this is obviously smaller. I don't even miss or notice the smaller screen. I was a little hesitant on the smaller screen of the pixel. But almost immediately I didn't even notice the difference. I actually enjoy having a slightly smaller phone. The shipping was great from this seller as well. These were just a few Standout things from an average person like me. I use my phone for absolutely everything and a quality phone is extremely important. I look forward to using this phone for 2+ years at least. I hope some of this helps anyone on the fence!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I love this phone so far especially considering it's only $350. I'm rough on phones I've broken every phone I've owned except one do with every other phone having a price point of nearly $1000 that's just not something I want to carry around in my pocket all the time.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It's a good price and phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Maybe it's just me but the fingerprint reader only reads my left index finger and not my right. I'm only 20 so I don't think my prints would be worn off from years of working. The battery is fantastic however and there's more storage on this phone than ANYbody needs. It's definitely worth the money.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I've used Pixel 3a for about a year and love that phone, now my wife needed new one and I got her this Pixel 4a instead of her old Samsung. She loves this phone as well. Great screen, amazing camera, very easy to use and full of features. The only complaint is no memory card slot for music or photos (not everyone has unlimited data plan). I would say Pixels like this one are the best phones you can get in this price range. People who complain about things like plastic body and other minor things perhaps need to realize they buy $350 unlocked phone, not $900 phone. You don't buy brand new car for 18 grands and complain that it doesn't have leather seats and all wheel drive, right?",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Awesome!!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone came DOA, it wont charge anymore. EDIT: I have read some other reviews and it seems I was not the only one with these energy/battery issues.

That said, I was ready for a new phone and did a lot of research. I also had a chance to spend some time with a Pixel 4 to compare it. So the following are my impressions: First off, what's different from the Pixel 4: You are missing the aluminum frame, the facial recognition, the edge squeeze, the water resistance, a specific camera lens and some camera features, wireless charging, and an 800 series processor. I think that's about it. The thing is, other than the water resistance, I personally don't miss any of that. What you get in return is a slightly bigger screen, a better battery, and a brighter screen (you have to use adaptive brightness for it to work). This is also a fair bit lighter. Also a personal preference is that I prefer the fingerprint reader over facial recognition. For me it's the perfect little phone. Full disclosure, I paid about $260 since I bought it from Amazon Warehouse. Nonetheless, this phone hits all the right spots for me. It is light, it has a clear and bright screen, it is fast, takes amazing pictures, it isn't bloated with preinstalled apps, and is future proof in that you can update for 3 years, the sound is pretty great, and honestly I can't find much to complain about. The only thing I wish this had was the water resistance. Accidents happen. Also keep in mind that this is plastic with an outdated Guerilla 3 screen. Buy a case. Buy a screen protector. If you do, I can't see why this phone won't be a great phone for you unless you only buy the $1000 flagships with all the bells and whistles, in which case, why are you even reading this review? One last thought. The battery is fine by me. I can make it through the day and longer with moderate use. No wireless charging, but it charges from zero to full in pretty much less than an hour, so I always find time within the day to plug it in and then I'm good to go. Usually at dinner time or whatever when I don't want to be disturbed anyway. Had a chance to to go with the Pixel 4, chose to go with this instead (mostly because the Pixel 4 screen is waaaaay to dim). Thanks Google for this amazing cheap phone!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Spent over 7 hours in the T-mobile store only to learn the phone is not compatible. Otherwise it seems like a great phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I had a Pixel 2XL, and it was working fine, but no longer supported with updates from Google. I bought this one, everything transferred over to this new phone seamlessly. I was concerned about the battery life after reading reviews, but I have no issues with it lasting throughout the day. It charges quite fast. I like the size better than the 2XL as it fits my hand better and is much more comfortable to hold. I also loved the price. I went with an Otterbox case for it, and love that as well.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Love this phone. It takes great pictures and is the most affordable of the ""good"" phones. Problem is the battery life is terrible.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Was a gift to my dad, who has been using a Nexus 6P for awhile. This is a huge upgrade for him. I could have got him a cheaper android, or an expensive iphone, but i settled for a pixel. I myself use a pixel 2 since 2017 I think, and am happy with it, so that had me leaning toward pixel to gift him. He says it has good battery and is fast. It is also much lighter than the nexus 6p. Seems comparable in size and feel go my pixel 2. Overall, a Good cheaper iphone alternative. Basic phone Setup took less than 10minutes. I simply took the simcard out his old phone and popped it into the pixel 4a. He uses consumer cellular. He says it works great. I noticed he needs the email account setup to access apps in the play store, however. Will update this review with any more information as time passes.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I originally had a Pixel 3a for a year but decided to sell it in May 2020 to try something else. I went to a Xiaomi Note 9 Pro, Samsung S20 FE, Realme 6 Pro, Samsung S20 FE again, and now the Pixel 4a. I could have avoided all of those phones if I just stuck with Pixel. The instant security and OS updates, compact form factor, ease of flashing custom ROMs and reverting back to stock with Google's online tool, excellent battery life, and bloat free, fast software experience are what make Pixel the best. I commonly get 6.5hrs screen on time with auto brightness and light theme on. Although I really enjoyed the Xiaomi and Realme, they do not support VoLTE and WiFi calling in the US with US carriers. Samsung even though they have the best hardware, OneUI is by far my least favorite Android skin. I was GLAD to lose the superior screen, speakers, 5G, 120Hz, and WiFi 6 on the S20 FE to go to the lesser Pixel because the software experience is just that much faster and better. I forgot how much faster and more accurate physical fingerprint readers were compared to the in screen ones. Pixel 4a is definitely the phone you should go for. In my experience, 5G in my area is really not better, if not worse than 4G LTE especially since the 5G in my area is low band non stand alone. The 5G speeds were the same as 4G and I experienced higher latency in certain areas. For this reason I'd choose the 4a over the 4a 5G unless you want the bigger screen. The 4a should have been $299 to compete more with the OnePlus Nord N10 but the extra $50 is well worth it for the longer software support Pixel provides. Overall an excellent phone and I HIGHLY recommend it after having used most major phone brands within a short period of time.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Phone for personal use. Absolutely not user friendly, compared to LG phone I had previously. This is a ""typical"" Google ""nerd"" phone that is designed for techies, not for ""normal"" older users. Camera is great I guess--use it about once every month--I have cameras. Battery and charging are excellent. Non-standard USB cord provided--need to buy others for car,etc. Big problem has been phone never rings, or when it does, it impossible to ""swipe"" to open. Bad notifications (none) Never know when messages or voice mail is received--have to manually check. Google continually send automatic notices and pop-ups to sell more products--can't turn off. When you turn off one function, it will normally turn OFF others, e.g., sound, so you never get notices of calls. Biggest advantage is that it is a smaller phone, 5+ by 2+ inches, easier to carry than the nerd 7"" X 3"" monsters. I bought it partly for blue-tooth connectivity, which is OK. My LG was 100% more user friendly.I had bought the Apple LS, but it died within a week, so I went back to Android--Big Mistake. Now have to eat $500 to change, LG does not make the small phone anymore. No one does it seems. My phone hone is used primarily for calls. Do not need an additional pre-installed 45 google apps on the phone that lacks basic functionality. Google does not understand user design=KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)!! P.S. TYPICAL GOOGLE--NO USER DOCUMENTATION--GO TO UTUBE .",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"So google Pixels are awesome, just got the Pixel 5. what they are almost the same, both uses stock android, what if you love android, you are going to love this! The screen are great and camera, well I don`t need to talk about Pixel cameras, they are well known. I will go in more details on my review on Pixel 5. I refunded this one just because of the battery, it said that it might go up to 24 hours... Well that if you don`t use it at all, just to answer calls and that is it. My battery lasted 12 hours, 4 hours of screen use. With normal daily uses, messaging, Whatsapp, facebook now and then, no gaming or heavy photography. With gaming and photo taking. it lasted about 8 hours, with also about 4 hours of screen use. So do you get this or pixel 5? I got pixel 5.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It was seamless to transfer all my data from my old phone. Fingerprint reader is on backside of phone, but surprisingly more comfortable to use. Camera is what really makes this phone more relevant compared to other bargain smart phones. The battery last all day, even for mobile gamers. The back side is plastic, but it is actually better for me because i tend to drop things..a lot. I think that the Pixel 4a to be the best bargain for your $$$",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've been a fan of the Google phone since they released the original Nexus phone over a decade ago. I've been through the good and the bad, and can confidently say that the 4a is one of the best Android phones that I've seen offered from Google. The phone has enough processing power to run the most recent Android operating systems and enough storage for my needs. The battery life is at the top of the pack for Android phones and the camera takes BEAUTIFUL pictures. USB-C charging is fast and the phone works well with third-party chargers. I've had no issues pairing it with my car or headsets and transferring over all of my data from my previous phone was a snap. One *really* nice feature of this phone is that it is dual-SIM capable; you can have both a virtual and a physical SIM. If, like me, you carry a phone for work and a personal phone, you can consolidate down to one device and choose which carrier you use for your outgoing phone calls, and data, while being able to text and call from either number. If you are in the Android ecosystem, this is the phone to get.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Muy buen producto, tamaño ideal, todo pantalla, excelentes prestaciones",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It's speedy, great camera, lightweight but sturdy, the screen isn't a fingerprint magnet, storage is good, no Bloatware, timely updates. About the only two things, I don't like and it really isn't the phone it's the OS is the app drawer needs auto-classification of apps, and the removal of the audible prompt when using the Google assistant except for when you're connected to a Bluetooth device such as your car system.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I truly enjoy the Pixel 4a. It performs well and I like having the latest updates at all times. Sometimes there are glitches. It may crash at times, but nothing too noticeable.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I owned the first Android phone, the TMobile G1, and I've owned the Google Nexus phone, but I never owned a Pixel. Earlier phones left a lot to be desired, but not this one. I kind of wanted a Pixel phone but they were always a little outside my budget. After waiting awhile I finally decided to buy a Pixel 4a. Everything, the size, screen, performance (no lag), call and speaker quality, bluetooth and WiFi connectivity, 3.5 mm jack, battery life, and of course the camera are all outstanding. I'm extremely happy with this. I also bought the Crave case and OMOTON screen protectors. I look forward to a couple years of good service until I upgrade to the next version.

"I had to buy a new phone because my 2019 Motorola G7 was running out of security updates. I'm so glad I chose the Google Pixel 4a with their superb support for 3 years. Luckily, I found a Google Pixel 4a from Amazon Warehouse for $260 in acceptable condition. The condition of the phone was actually, nearly new!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
So far i am pleased with the cell phone but the baytery last 2 days with moderate use.that is one half the time of my previous phone but longer than a lot of iphones. I have data turned off and only use wifi.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have small hands. Most of the phones out there are big now. And I am looking for a small phone that is not premium or flagship priced. And Pixel 4a meets that need. Since there are already excellent reviews in YouTube and Amazon, I will just add my personal experience with the phone. Pixel 4a fits nicely in my hand now. I can use the phone with one hand without fumbling it. My previous phone Moto G7 while great still was a little big for my hands. I do not support iPhone ecosystem, so I was looking for Android. My wife's phone Pixel 3a was great in my hands so I thought I would check out Pixel 4a and it has bigger screen yet smaller than 3a! So I grabbed it and using it for a month, I am really satisfied. Size and weight are perfect and the performance is more than I need (I am not a gamer, so I don't need a powerful processor). The screen is OLED and is clearly better than IPS LCD screens. The colors are just more rich and pop out than IPS LCD. Battery lasts more than 1 full day (my average screen time is between 3 - 4 hours). And the camera! Wow... It is really good. I've heard it was good, but actually seeing it - I was really impressed. The ONLY thing I wish Pixel 4a had was: Water and dust proof feature (IP 68). But for $350, this phone is amazing. And you also get 3 year software update guarantee. So if you are not looking for a premium phone, but something small yet powerful and takes great pictures, then Pixel 4a is an excellent choice! Highly recommended!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It took a bit of work, but I was able to unlock the boot loader and flash with someone's custom version of lineageOS. For those looking for a degoogled phone this seems to be the simplest option I've ran into. I am not impressed with the battery life, but I have been able to get 1-2 days out of it. The phone's performance feels like my Samsung S9, but the plastic build of the phone is horrible. It is lighter weight than my S9, but being plastic it isn't as good to hold and slides on everything. I highly recommend getting a case for it!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Wow, what a phone. Perfect size (better than any other phone). Great full screen (much better than the ugly iphone notch). Amazing pictures. Solid video. Battery is fantastic. Great, great, experience thus far (after 4-5 days). I was on the line between this and the pixel 5 and man am I glad I went with this. All the features I need. To me there's no need for official waterproofing etc because it holds up just fine in rain etc. I'm not trying to throw my phone into a pool. But you know what? Even if I do and it doesn't survive, I can BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR $350!!! Buy this phone!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"For the price, this phone rules. I don't know what the negative reviewers are talking about. It doesn't feel that cheap, the battery life is pretty good, and it's snappy and responsive. It even has a headphone jack. I have no problem with the embedded screen camera and I'm not sure how anyone would find it that bothersome - it's kind of cute. The only thing I find annoying is in the software not the hardware, I'd like to be able to disable right-edge back-swipe, for certain apps. But you can reduce the detection area. If you are going to be using it frequently outdoors the brightness gets high but only barely enough for acceptable viewing on a sunny day.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I chose this phone for it's excellent camera reviews. However, it's drawbacks for me are: 1. No micro sd card slot, so I couldn't transfer my music (saved to sd) over easily 2. Short battery life- if it's used heavily during the day, it doesn't last the whole day. I'd probably go for something else, if I could go again.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Turned on the phone and it's broken. It's stuck on the reboot. So it's deadlocked. Waited a week for the phone that doesn't work. What a joke.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I bought the Pixel 4A (Not the 4A 5G) to replace a older HTC model which is no longer being updated. Before buying it I looked at other phones and found that most didn't get regular OS or Security updates or if they did it was months after the update became available which makes me nervous. When looking at a lot of the other phones I found that most came with built in apps that quite frankly I would never use and more often than not you couldn't un install which I don't like one bit. The Pixel 4A came with a lot of google apps (Most of which can be uninstalled which is a breath of fresh air) and the apps that can't be uninstalled like Google assistant (Which is part of the OS) can be completely turned off unlike some other assistant apps from other companies which really helps preserve my privacy. I am extremely pleased and pleasantly surprised with the ability to turn things off or uninstall the apps I don't want. Unlike many people I don't use my phone a lot so I only have to charge it twice a week so batterie life is great! The phone has worked perfectly since I got it and Over all I am extremely pleased with the purchase!! I would definitely reccomend this phone to anyone!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I would never buy a Google Pixel 4a again. The phone simply quit working. The message is: ""Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted and may not work properly."" It gave me a link to go to in order to troubleshoot. I tried everything. Nothing worked. All I get is that screen or a white screen with the Google logo. I researched this problem online and have read that it has happened to many others. I am a very unhappy Pixel customer.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"First off the price seems a little steep. But it takes great photos. I would like it to notify me that I have a text message by touch.

"Mine replaced a Pixel (1). I loved the fingerprint reader on the back. My wife upgraded hers earlier and got a Pixel 3 which still had the reader on back. Camera is awesome, battery life seems to have doubled but maybe just a new phone and size. I did not need the 5G microwave blasting me. 4G is just fine. Like the new features like swipe to go back...too bad not also swipe forward in browser (I hate that on a phone). Camera nice, but could have been better. Glad they did not have the face crap recognition.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S5 mini. This 4a is much snappier and Android 11 has evolved quite a bit since the Samsung's V5. The GPS works MUCH better than the S5 and the fingerprint reader on the backside works really well.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought this and totally didn't realize the camera was IN THE SCREEN. Actually really annoying, especially when I am reading an online comic or something.

"While I love the latest Android OS and how responsive this phone is, as well as its great battery life, the phone has one fatal flaw that you need to be aware of. The phone is extremely sensitive to the presence of moisture, and for many of us, it has died in circumstances that any other phone would do just fine in. Mine died when I had it in the pocket of my waterproof ski pants for 2.5 hours on the ski slope, on a rainy day. The pocket was zipped closed the entire time, and I didn't remove the phone from the pocket until I was in my car. The pocket was not wet inside, even the tissue in the pocket was dry. However my phone's display, when turned on, lit up, but was unresponsive to touch. A day later the same. I can see a very slight haze of humidity on the inside of the selfie lens. I suspect the high humidity in the pocket was enough to short out the screen. Buyer beware - I recommend you Google the issue before purchasing.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
More than happy with my purchase,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

It's a 350$ unlocked smart phone. No frills with a good camera perfect for a person who doesn't want to spend 1200$ on something that becomes a paperweight in 2 years. Camera is great some complained about the processing time on normal photos but for me they seem to be done instantly. Must have been an update. Gaming is pretty limited in this device. Again it's 350$ the pixel is meant for someone that wants world connectivity with a good camera. Battery life isn't bad. I don't spend more then 2 hours a day on it. And it lasts almost a day and a half. Charger seems fairly quick at roughly 45 min to go from high teens to the 80% range. Bought two phones and had one black screen of death after 3 days of use. Luckily Amazon exchanged it no questions asked. This is why I purchased it from Amazon rather than direct through Google. Google will make you jump through hoops and do repairs first. This is why I gave the phone 4 stars. Seems to be a re accuring problem with the 4a.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Battery life is pretty unremarkable, I get about a day of use with it. Screen is actually smaller than my last phone. Speakers are also pretty average, didn't impress me at all. My Motorola sounded way better. I had to get a new phone since my carrier didn't want to support VOLTE on that model. Decided I'd go with this since it's affordable for a Pixel.

"Excellent phone and features. No overlayed brand bloat software, no brand promoted apps you can't get rid of, no third party branded internet browser you can't uninstall ,and the pure Android runs really smooth and fast.You can add Firefox,Opera,or any browser you wish. Fits well in one hand for single-handed use while still fitting in a pocket.There's probably nothing better in the price range if you need CDMA and GSM ability in one phone.I transferred all settings,contacts ,messages and phone number with the provided cable and was able to use my old sim with no issues. No hassle. I don't understand why this is often compared to flagship phones in the $600 up range -it's not.Google makes others beside the Pixel 4a if you need 5G or some trendy features. If you are upgrading from a cheaper,outdated OS LG,Samsung,Motorola phone this is a clear winner.Two or three times the ram and most likely double the storage of your old phone. It does have a plastic back,but it's very sturdy without flex and better made than my LG and previous Samsung that will never offer system updates.. The Pixel 4a came with Android 10 and has already updated to 11.Display is good , even in sunlight where cheap phones may not be. The speakers do not rival $800 phones, but they are very good sounding compared to $100-250 phones;much better than the rear firing speakers I was used too. Bluetooth and wireless signal and sound quality are strong as well,with better speed on wireless.. The single lens camera is great for low light and sharp images in .raw or standard .jpeg like most folks use - far superior color, sharpness, and exposure than other phones also rated at 12 MP- but note that you can't adjust the shutter speed or f stop like a S20FE or S10 - but I really don't need three lenses ,I have a dslr for that.There's an 8mp front camera that performs well too. There's no SD card slot,and I initially thought that was a minus since I use a 64GB SD for music.But I don't have any problems with the 128GB. You can swap or copy files to/from a PC or tablet with a 3.0 USBA to usb C cable like any phone; perhaps slower depending on your PC or tablet USB ratings.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I both cases I had to restart the phone manually since even the restart on the screen was frozen. Hope it's just a software issue that can be fixed when google pushes out a newer software version. The rest is fine.

"This phone was purchased after extensive research and positive first hand experience with the Pixel 3a. After several weeks of waiting for the new phone to ship after it was released, I am very pleased with the functionality of this new Pixel 4a. One of the biggest selling points for this phone is the price. I didn’t want to finance another $800 phone from Verizon so I opted for an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network. This phone was a bargain at $349, but there is nothing cheap about this phone except for the price. The Good: Besides winning on price, this phone was a breeze to set up. The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue. The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly. The Pixel 4a also transferred all data, apps, and pictures from my old Galaxy S7. It used a USB cable to connect and download everything. Even texts, voicemails, and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost. Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over. Apps needed to be logged into again and there were some forgotten password issues, but nothing that couldn't be fixed. Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate. It is a bit different than th 3a and other Android phone as there is no back button and everything is controlled through swipes. It takes some getting used to but works smoothly once you get it down. The camera is outstanding and surpasses any phone previously used. Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features. This battery lasts all day long even with regular use. The battery on the 3a is great and the battery on the 4a is awesome! It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge takes approximately one hour. The Bad: The bad really isn’t all that bad when taken in proper context. There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since it’s missing some luxury features. Apparently this phone isn’t waterproof, which comes as a surprise to me since I’ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water. Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing. It really isn't a big deal though since the battery lasts so long this phone is rarely on the charger anyway. This phone does take a USC-C cable so it isn't compatible with the cables from older Android and Kindle devices, which use Micro USB cables. It comes with one USB-C cable but you may want to purchase another if you like extra ones around the house or in the car. Again, not a huge deal because of the battery life. Summary: This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users. It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is, making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones. It wins in value, setup, camera, operating speed and battery life. Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have, but those don’t weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 4a so I am giving this a strong four stars.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"At the top of the home screen you have an at-a-glance widget. And at the bottom, a google search bar. I don't want either of those things on my phone and there is no way to remove them without installing a different build. The search bar I can at least understand because it feels like more of a part of the OS, but the at-a-glance widget is inexcusable. It's just a widget, let me remove it. What an appalling product decision.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I got this great deal from Amazon for the Pixel 4a - it was arrived very fast. The phone works as expected and no issue with the transition from Pixel 3 XL.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I love the mobile with all the futures , also nice in the hand , the best camera ^_^",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Had this phone for about 24 hours so far and loving it. Simple to use just gotta get use to the change from my old phone. So far my only complaint is you can't add an sd card of you need or want to have more storage. Takes great pictures, has interesting ringtone's and notification options, and fingerprint scanner is pretty accurate. Will update a new review once the ""Honeymoon"" phase is past 😉😀",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I haven't really had any high-end phone experience before so I can't compare this to more expensive ones, but from what I experienced so far, nothing stands out beside the great camera, but it also feels nothing is lacking. For the $350 price point, I have no complaint on this. Some people talk about battery life being lower than their expectation, but I feel it lasts fairly.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I felt like it was time for an upgrade and I began my search for a durable phone. I needed a phone with great battery life and a camera that takes selfies very quickly. When I looked into Google's offerings, I was enticed by the features and most importantly the PRICE! For only $350, I get a high-res camera, 24-hour battery life, a bright and crisp screen, a fast processor, and most shockingly a headphone jack. Many new flagship phones have been phasing it out since 2016, but I did not expect it to be featured on a brand-new phone from a big company like Google. I believe my purchase is a great value, and it's rare to get that feeling whenever I buy something new. I'm confident this phone will last me another few years (Google even has promised 3 years of firmware updates). I believe this is one of the most daring Android phones I've had in the past several years.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Purchased for my son. He was caught in n the rain with the Pixel in his pocket and the water ruined it. I know for certain his Moto G7 would have been fine.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Honestly I love this phone. It's quite the step up from the Galaxy j7 I had before. The fingerprint scanner is so good, i've never had issues with it being able to read my fingerprint. The next thing I love about this phone is the camera. The camera is amazing. It's able to zoom in really nicely and even has a night time mode where it is able to capture more light which makes dark pictures much more vibrant. The screen is very scratch resistant as well and even tho the phone is made out of plastic, i havent had any issues with body damage even tho i have dropped it once or twice. But that's probably bcuz I keep it in a case. The only thing that I was a bit disappointed by was the battery life which is not as good as my last phone and runs down quickly when I have the brightness up too high. But I havent had a super big issue with running out of battery life before the end of the day. I think this phone is a really good deal for its price point. totally worth it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I switched from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to the Google Pixel 4a (not 5G). Overall it is good, but one BIG feature that does not work is the phone ringtone compatibility with a bluetooth-enabled hearing aid. I wear Phonak Audeo M90-RT hearing aids, and on the S8, the phone would ring in my hearing aid with my desired ringtone, but only vibrate on the phone unless the hearing aid was off. Then it would both ring and vibrate on the phone itself. On the Pixel 4a, apparently by design, the only available ringtone options are ring, vibrate or silent. Regardless of the ringtone set, I get some chimes in my hearing aid. I called Google tech support and was told this is working as designed, even though other notifications work as I want. They said it is a difference between media settings and ringtones and ringtones could not do what I wanted and that nobody had reported this issue before. They told me that even though both phones are android, Samsung has made modifications that Google has not. This is a big deal to me, and while I am happy with the phone overall, I probably would not have purchased it if I had known this.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"After two different carrier stores, both told me my phone was defective and to return to seller. Wifi and SIM Card reader both non functioning.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Greatest phone ever,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great functionality and quality. Easy to download all my stuff from an older smartphone to new by myself. I just love this phone more and more. Lots of YouTubes available to help.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is my first android phone and I can say the 5.8 inch makes the phone size perfect on my hands. The light and slim body is a plus. Camera - The camera is comparable to that of the iPhone 11 Pro Max the Samsung Galaxy s20 Ultra. This is one of the only budget phones that has night mode which beats the more expensive SE that doesnt have it. Speakers - At this price, you wouldn't expect the speaker to sound. Believe it or not, the stereo speaker sounds pretty good. Mids are decent, bass are present. Microphone also works great. Cons: No wireless charging. That's it. That's the only con. Other than that, this phone is suitable for those looking for phones thats geared towards value. If you are a student, this phone is for you.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone! I take a lot of photos... Many of my photos are taken in the city, often while the passenger in a moving vehicle. This smaller profile Pixel is perfect! As well as having TONS of memory...the camera is fantastic. I 'downsized' from the Pixel 4XL... this is JUST as fantastic, but much more manageable while in motion. All the features you need, without all the extra stuff you will never use anyway. I have had the phone several days, and only charged it twice... Even though the phone has a smaller profile, the screen is not small...Same brilliant phone, just a bit smaller. You will love it!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
perfect mobile,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Physically this phone is great, battery life is excellent. The issue is with the app that comes with the phone. Google has had tons of complaints about their messaging app, but they haven't done a thing about it. I actually need a phone that can text, and text reliably so most likely will be returning it if Google don't get their act together.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"One of the best cameras out there, period. Its only competition comes in the form of the iPhone SE, which it still beats in every category except for video recording (almost on par) and having iOS. Don't get a One Plus phone over the Pixel",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I didn't need to buy this phone. But it was so cheap that I bought one just to play with a modern Pixel phone. For the money, this is probably the best phone you can buy, especially on the Android side, and especially if you love that ""pure Android"" factor. Yes, Pixels aren't ""pure Android"", but close enough in a post-Nexus world. And the Pixel-specific features are outstanding. Even though the camera isn't the top-tier hardware we'd expect from flagships, Google's computational photography is unrivaled. Compared to my iPhone 11 and older Galaxy S8+, the Pixel 4a absolutely is at least as good, if not better. I bought this phone, however, to test the video capabilities. No surprise, it's not as good as the iPhone 11. But again, for the money, it's really good. Filmic Pro will overheat the phone when shooting in high resolutions and frame rates, but that's expected on Android anyway. The biggest downside for this phone is the screen--it's definitely not bright enough, but it still looks good. The fingerprint reader is blazing fast, and despite being a much lower power processor in this phone it still holds up quite well to most use cases. Honestly, if you want a Pixel without paying nearly flagship prices, this should be your pick.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Stopped working a few days after I got it,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Good phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was expecting disappointment for $350, but this is really good for the price. Charge lasts several days if you don't use it very often, last the whole day if you're streaming music and browsing. I'm sure that if you're used to premium $800 handsets with 90hz+ refresh rates and blisteringly fast processors you'll probably notice a difference switching to this. For someone like me who's been using midrange phones consistently for the past 10 years, honestly this feels good, zippy even compared to the aging phone I just replaced (a blackberry key one).",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

This phone is good as a backup phone. No more than that. Nothing surprising. People could have more and better choices.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Coming from a 3a XL, and have no complaints. A great phone, all around, with an even better camera. Effortless photos!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My main reason for purchasing this phone is storage and quality camera. I was not disappointed! Amazing quality camera with the option of multiple shots taken to choose the best one. Google creates automatic collages from pictures and will even bring back ""memories"" from years ago. Great storage space as well. Fingerprint reader was a bonus, although I've noticed it is not 100% all the time. Perhaps due to my cleaning and disinfecting of my phone with COVID season.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The software is great, fast, and reliable. But, honestly the hardware is just average. There should be multiple cameras on any new phone at this price range this year. The processor is a not top of the line either and the battery life is fine, but nothing outstanding. You're buying this phone to get access to a Pixel phone that works well. It checks all those boxes. The camera quality is excellent, possibly the best single camera around. But, as soon as you look around at the competition globally, this is severely underwhelming. The phone feels outdated already and it's new. Add to that that Google doesn't give you perks like original quality uploads to Google Photos anymore and they don't include facial recognition, it just feels like they aren't trying hard enough. The phone is otherwise great, works well, runs smoothly, and doesn't have any issues or annoyances. And some of the software features are wonderful, like automatically recognizing songs without having to open an app.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I had a Pixel 3 and the battery started to drain really quickly. I was a little skeptical about this phone but for the price point it's really great! The battery life is amazing for this phone and it's about the same size as my Pixel 3. I'm really pleased with this purchase.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"While this isn't the highest end phone on the market, it has really great features, a very decent processor, and unexpectedly long battery life for the size. The battery life may be benefiting from the smaller OLED screen. The finger print sensor works consistently and is easy to reach. This phone is chalk full of the latest Google features. Granted some of them are gimmicks, but you'll be able to impress your friends with a 350USD phone. The camera is probably the pixel 4as biggest selling point. The funny thing is it isn't really the camera itself that makes it good. It's all the software that allows 1 camera to emulate the functions of a lot of 4-camera phones. And this emulsion is pretty good. For instance, the portrait mode is able to give that depth is field effect without a depth sensor. I didn't even buy this phone for the camera, so I like the fact that I'm not paying for 6 cameras but I'm still getting the same functions.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This is a great phone. It could do better on battery life but it does perform well and it features an excellent camera. I highly recommend.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This pixel 4A is horrible. There are so many glitches it is ridiculous. The key bad constantly messes up letters. And the screen sensitivity is so much that when you're scrolling through pages it will randomly select links that you do not want. The fingerprint to unlock the screen has a long delay and takes a few seconds to open. The Pixel 2 I had before is superior to this phone in every way! I need to return this immediately.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Super value for daily use phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Okay, I'm switching from a Redmi note 8 pro to the google pixel 4a. I have mixed feelings about this device. I'll get to the picture part at the end. This device is small. Iphone 6s is about the same size both in length and width. It feels super cheap. Like a prepaid phone that costs $80 dollars at your local walgreens. The interface is not snappy and quick like the YouTube reviewers say it is. It is average. My budget Redmi note 8 pro costs 200 dollars less than this device and it's a better experience. I found the fingerprint reader doesn't always work, when it works it feels like ages to actually unlock. The same thing with entering a pin. It feels like it takes a long time to actually unlock. Who is this phone for? Someone who isn't really on a phone all the time, it's not a powerhouse scrolling Instagram is okay YouTube is okay, the small display is just a let down. I don't know what model the youtubers are showing you because this device is small. Like really small. Like this would be fine for a child. Okay the camera. Beautiful pictures in good light, okay pictures in really low light, now comes the bad part about the camera. In areas that have light but it's not dark enough for night mode the pictures come out noisy and grainy. Like indoors at 4 pm. For $350 I strongly recommend a Xiaomi device. Or step up to the google pixel 5.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This cellphone doesn't support wireless charging.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Not very pleased with the pixel 4a. The back function is not ideal. All to often it closes the app or page instead of backing up just one screen. Can get frustrating when comparing items or info on the internet. The bluetooth will not connect to my vehicle. The phone says it cannot communicate with the car system. All my other phones have and still do. Looking on the pixel issues posted, other people are having similar issues. If I can't find a fix to connect, I may return as I'm not trading cars.. The wifi and network connection is fine, no problem s, speed of phone is acceptable. If it would only connect to kenwood car components it would be an acceptable phone. Handsfree driving is important to me.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"fast and has lots of features. this is a 4k phone, I've used a 5k phone and I can't tell a difference. I don't use my phone watch movies so screen size was not that important to me. For phone and texting and the occasional you tube video it surpasses my needs. Loud in call volume, screen resolution is very good even in sunlight. I purchased a case for it, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08G86WZJF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, and it has worked out perfectly.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Everything is awesome. Don't mind my 5 star rating for face recognition - it's because I don't like this feature and this phone doesn't have one. I like plastic body even if it creaks a bit from pressure. The phone is cold, you can make video calls for more than 2-3 hours and play something - your pixel won't heat your hand too much. Stereosound is another cool addition. Battery is perfect for medium/high usage for 1 day. I use my phone with transparent silicon case and tempered glass in front. Screen protector doesn't fill all the space to the corners so I'm still trying to find another glass for full screen coverage. Hope this phone will age well. I changed my pixel 1 to this 4a and this is definitely a large step forward.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Videos get cut off on the bottom, can't read sub titles. Settings are different from previous models, pain to adjust volume. Have to double press button to get it to change while in video.

"I'm coming from a samsung android note 9. Loved my note 9 but turns out I'm not that good with big bulky all glass expensive phones... Who woulda thought🤔 ... My whole back of my note 9 phone was shattered and the screen was cracked and I had an otterbox on it the entire time I had the thing. Long story short I bought the phone out after 2 years to switch services and when I went to switch they took my case off to switch sim cards and it was a shattered mess which I was highly disappointed about because I thought it was in good shape!. I could have gotten it fixed for around $400 or I could get a different phone. I didn't want nothing hella expensive I'm tired of having to pay extra for phone payments and then just breaking them because obviously I'm just not good with phones! I wanted something budget friendly with a good quality camera but still similar to androids system. I've been team android forever now I just really don't care for their picture quality though, I have tried iphone out as well I had the iphone x and it just wasn't for me, however I did love the picture quality, so since I've tried both ios and android and have certain things I like and disliked for both of them I figured it was time to give pixels a try! Pros: This phone is cute, little, and light weight phone, but like not so little that the screens no good. The screen to phone ratio is super nice and makes the phone feel smaller with a good sized screen. Which is what I wanted I was over having huge, heavy bulky phones, I have little hands and I constantly was dropping my bigger phones... Picture quality is awesome! It def beats android and I think it might even beat iphones! Easy set up with transferring from my old phone to this one. The backs plastic! Which that was what I was looking for! People complain that ""oh its so boring looking with the plain black plastic back""... I don't get it, so youd rather have a pretty glass back that you end up covering with a bulky case... Cause that makes so much sense... I like how you can either have the navigation buttons or you can use the swipe controls. I like this so your not stuck with one or the other. battery lifes pretty good the charge seems to last me as long as my note 9 did. It def seems very durable. I do have a screen protector along with a case on this phone, not even a good case or screen protector just something cheap I grabbed. I've dropped the phone a few times now and no have had no issues! Volume is also pretty good Cons: My biggest pet peeves with this phone isssss I hate the way screen shots are on this phone! Okay so the power button and the volume down button is how you take screen shots, which is normal for screen shots but on this phone the volume buttons and the power button are on the same side which makes it awkward to do and then sometimes when doing it the volume bar will pop up and turn everything all the way down and the bar just stays there which is annoying.... I don't like how there's not as much customization as androids would have, such as changing the themes and stuff which sorta disappoints me. Conclusion: All in all, the pixel 4a really is not a bad budget phone for people like me that are just to rough for these high end all glass, thousand dollar phones... I would eventually like to get one of the nicer pixels this one was mostly to try it out and see if I even like them before getting one of the more expensive ones later down the road. Nice thing about pixels even there higher end phones such as the pixel 5 arent robbing you like some of these dang androids and iphones are! If your looking for a nice budget phone you won't go wrong getting this one. Would recommend!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have had this phone about a month. I came from a Moto G5s plus which was a lower end phone than even this one. So, I figured this would be a great step up as other reviews have said. The phone does take excellent pictures unlike my previous phone. However, the manueverability between screens is just cumbersome. The gesture to see all the screens that are open is almost the same as the gesture to bring up the menu of all apps. It is difficult to get the back screen gesture to work. I have to gesture across the screen from right to left two or three times before it responds. The volume is fairly low even at the highest setting. For me, this wasn't a great choice.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

The touchscreen is now too sensitive, registering taps when you're scrolling and not letting you smoothly use the phone... For anything. This is NOT an isolated issue either. There are hundreds of reports of the same issue on Google's support site. The worst thing is Google knows about this issue with Android 11 but hasn't done anything to fix it for weeks.

In the mean time--the Pixel 4a is the way to go until these cell phone makers can get it together and give as a ""dream phone."" For $350 you can't go wrong and it is a pure Android experience, no junk, no preinstalled Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, etc., etc. People talk about the processor speed but this phone is fast without all the junk running in the background that you'll find on other phones.

"I purchased my Pixel 4a for a couple of reasons. My iPhone 7 Plus was getting a little long in the tooth and I'd been considering an upgrade but even as an iPhone user since the original one, I'd become a bit turned off by ever increasing pricing on Apple's phones. Also, as a product of the Walkman generation I really missed having a headphone jack. Fast forward four months and I'm using an iPhone 12 Pro Max.. what went wrong? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The Pixel 4a is a really great phone. Nice form factor, always on display, fast and responsive fingerprint reader, a headphone jack and frequent updates to its operating system. My only real misgiving is the lack of wireless charging, which is quickly becoming essential to me. This is a great phone that you can customize to your heart's content, and if you're not entrenched in Apple's ecosystem you can probably go ahead and purchase without any reservations. I say 'probably', because I felt very ready to pick up and move away from Apple's ecosystem, however your circle of friend, family and co-workers should be taken into account. What do the people in your life use? If it's primarily iPhone, that may provide some friction to your transition over to Android. In my case I found that not being connected to iMessage and Facetime was enough of an inconvenience that I was using my iPod Touch to replace the features I no longer had access to on my phone. Silly, right? That was my conclusion, and I went ahead and bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max. Do I LIKE one more than the other? I suppose the iPhone 12 does feel a bit more premium, due largely to the fact that it is... I don't think it's a question of 'like', though. Your phone is more a question of fit for your life, and as positively as I felt about the Pixel 4a, the fit wasn't quite right. Things may be different for you, but I can stand behind the Pixel 4a as a quality phone and a bargain at its list price.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Bought it for my mom as a gift & she is loving it! 😇,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I purchased this phone for my husband for Christmas. He likes the phone a lot and has not had any issues with it. It takes great photos, gets updated more frequently and holds a charge for a lot longer.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"very pleased with phone,battery lasts a long time",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It was not clear that a purchase of SIM card was essential to make the phone work. So have ordered one. Also the fingerprint ID took many attempts to register. I am still excited to try this out. Music sound was great. I am hoping to see the missed messages once the card is installed. Not an IT tech savy grandma - directions could have told me to insert card from the beginning and that would have been very helpful.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Best android mobile phone!!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"As an android user, this phone is a little difficult to work. It works like an iPhone which is frustrating for me. It is a great size and the picturs are great. The volume for the speaker is a bit low, but works fine. I am on week two of the phone and I started having difficulty sliding the screen up to reveal the apps. I am not sure why, I may be defective. Not that impressed as a basic phone user.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The main reason why I bought this phone was because I needed a better camera. And oh man does this phone really have a great camera. I added two photos I took with this camera. The ocean picture was at night in the complete dark. I was amazed to see how that photo came out. Besides the camera this phone has an amazing battery life and is very responsive. For the price this phone is unbeatable Pros Price Camera Responsiveness Design (very slim and sleek),Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Good value,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Nice and compact phone I ever used..Night mode is very nice.Potrait mode takes some time to process but result will be fantastic.. After two days of usage, found battery seems to much enough for me as I am not a heavy gamer and I use mostly for camera and calls. Pixel is too smooth though it has 60hz..And device is bit slippery in hand and it is better to protect it with case. I need to take the mobile each time in my hand if I need to use fingerprint to unlock.. If it has face unlock it will be fast enough like my iphone11. Otherwise speed,camera everything equals to iphone11 Edited: After one week of usage, found battery seems to be much optimized and I am getting one day solid.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I like almost everything about the Pixel 4a, but was quite disappointed when I learned that the advertised forthcoming upgrade to utilize 5G was not actually available in this version of the 4a -- apparently I purchased it a bit too early and got retrograde hardware that cannot use the software upgrade. :-(",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Compared to Iphone SE, i would prefer this..!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Worst new phone experience I`ve ever had. After spending lots of time to authenticate and configure in all apps I`ve installed my T-Mobile SIM card and discovered that the pone doesn`t have service. After troubleshooting with support, visiting T-Mobile store and trying all possible things including few other SIM cards I`m going to return it. Just waisted lot of time and energy on this. It has failed at the most basic phone feature - being a phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I like this phone a lot but not as much as my Android phones in the past. The pro is the Google integration. I was able to easily move all my Google app information over to the new phone. The con is some glitches and updates. It glitches on certain non-Google apps, though that seems to have been fixed after a while. I did an update yesterday and some things stopped working the way they did before which is annoying. The weirdest thing is sometimes Google Chrome will stop working on my phone. I have no idea why. However I have discovered that if I just turn my phone off and turn it back on that usually fixes it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Just what i was looking for, tho smaller than i thought it would be. And the camera needs no mention, just superb!👌🏽",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Really love this phone and all it can do. It was very simple to setup and get started. Use it for work and personal use and it works seamlessly. The interface is easy to understand and there isn't a lot of bloat ware on the device at setup.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone. Worth the price. Durable.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This got here super fast, battery lasts way longer than my old phone. Way less annoying notifications, and the camera is great!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is amazing. As someone who was in need of an upgrade on the android side of cell phones, I went with this phone simply because of the various positive reviews a saw of it on YouTube. I for one wanted a good camera on my phone and this device meets my need. Although video can be better, it is still usable. The still photos are awesome, no complaints there! It's an easy to use phone with good battery life and smooth performance. In my opinion, you are getting more for what you pay for. (Ignore any reviews below 4 stars, they are either paid to give a bad review, switched from a more pricey phone, or had a defective device)",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone, but tonight the camera did what's showing: brown lines in between. I don't know whether is because is a brand new model and it hasn't have any improvements or is just the camera. I don't want to return the phone but if this keeps going I will have to.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I've been rather impressed with this phone since I purchased it. I didn't set it up for about 6 weeks after I purchased it period but since then I've had it for about five weeks up and running and it's been wonderful my only complaint is the battery life is horrible truly is the three phones I've had before this lasted twice as long I can barely get through the day with minimal use period however I'm going to keep the phone it's worth it I love the features on it and it's a little bit smaller than my last phone but I have been able to enjoy it more than I thought I would recommend this product to my family and friends!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Doesn't have face recognition, don't know why you out it for ranking.. excellent phone for the price , best selfie and night mode camera, ecosystem it's amazing, battery life could be better, size is small but comfortable, although you need to use a case otherwise you will be touching the screen accidentally holding it ..",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was very excited about this phone. I read multiple glowing reviews. Phone arrived yesterday and I've spent several hours with it. I am coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy S8. There's nothing really wrong with that phone. It's just not getting updates anymore and I liked the thought of a pure Android phone. The S8 had some quirks such as a big delay in being able to take a picture while Google Maps was active (bad for road trips). Here are some thoughts/findings about the 4a vs the S8: 1. On the 4a I find it a bit frustrating to not being able to close apps as easily as on the S8 2. The S8 camera has more options - including a pro mode. I think it still takes marginally better pictures than the 4a 3. The Gboard has a space and down button at the bottom which is impossible to remove. Gboard on S8 does not have this 4. I find it very easy to hit the back button gesture by mistake on the the 4a and then have to open the app again 5. I immediately installed a case and screen protector on the 4a, but it still feels like I could easily drop it 6. The battery life isn't that great on the 4a - about the same as the 3 year old S8 I'd say 7. Stereo speakers on the 4a is nice - but you have to hold it about a foot away from your face to get the effect 8. 128 GB of included storage on the 4a is nice (vs 64 GB on the S8), but I also have a 200 GB SDCard in the S8 9. 4a gets hot! It has complained about not being able to do a few things (transcribe for example) because it was too hot Jury is still out if it will replace the S8 or not. And if it does replace it, what happens to the old phone? It's only worth $100 or less. I'd say if you were looking for a great phone for the money, and it's better that what you currently have, definitely get the 4a as it's a good price and has a lot of great features. However, carefully compare it against what you currently have as it might not really be that much better.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Very happy with the Pixel 4a, used to have a Pixel 2, and this upgrade was the best. An excellent phone for everyone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Good phone, GREAT camera, battery life seems to be where the compromise came to allow the decent price.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Loved this phone for the first 3 months until the Camera stopped working. Rear facing camera just black,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Love this phone! Intuitive, sleek, highly functional. I’ll never go back to Apple.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Coming from Pixel 2 - this one has met & surpassed all my expectations. Battery life is... wow (compared to my Pixel 2). The battery specs comparison on paper does it NO justice, and can't possibly explain how little this phone sips. Course, camera is amazing as expected. 10/10 so far (week old). Literally no complaints. Ol' Goog's knocked this one out of the park.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Really love the camera!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I've had my phone for a couple of months and over the past few weeks it keeps having to reset itself. It will probably have to go back to fix this. The battery doesn't last very long.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
everything works great,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"CONS: My main gripe is this phone feels like google is dropping beta on me as a user. Sometimes the phone answers phone calls from my doctors office that are recordings I need to hear, to only have google assistant in my phone cut it short. Google assistant in search of a place in my local area, I switch to map in the google assistant window. The map is broken when trying to move the map around, glitches and fails. I have to switch to maps to look for locations near me instead of google assistant. As for screen on auto rotate, the phone does not rotate automatically most of the time. These are simple software issues I deal with since day one. As for the physical hardware of the device I have no gripes other than a lack of ulrawide camera lens. PROS: Google photos cloud storage. Great main shooter for the standard 4:3 aspect ratio. Cpu is decent. Haptic feedback is great! Battery life is surprisingly good considering the battery size. The size is perfect for one hand use. The size for some could also be a con. I find it to be a nice balance. Stock android is much better than some, except Motorola.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I had an iPhone 10s. It started acting up and a reset didn't fix it. I couldn't justify spending that kind of money again so I bought this phone. I cannot believe what a great phone this is. Yes it definitely feels cheaper, but I put it in a case immediately so who cares. Between the clean functional operating system and just how well it works I couldn't be more pleased.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is literally everything I could ever want or need in a phone. I do not give two craps about multiple cameras or 90hz screens. The Pixel 4a is absolutely stunning for it's low price point. Double the storage than my last phone, a better camera, better screen, fantastic OS, updates for three years, free google photos storage.. and all for 50$ less than my previous phone! The camera is the selling point for me. It is just as good as the cameras on flagship phones, and it's only one camera. Google's software really seriously kicks ass. The touch screen is snappy and I don't find myself wishing it was faster, it responds immediately to touch, scrolls fast and looks vibrant. The screen to body ratio is perfect, really great job removing bezels. The hole punch is not at all irritating, I've had the phone about three weeks now and I am completely used to it. It blends in and works well with what is on the screen and there are plenty of wallpapers to suit it. It is much better than a notch of a bezel. It looks cool I think. The base storage being 128GBs is seriously nuts. My last phone I only got 64gbs, because in order to get the 128gb version it was $100 more! With 128gbs and free google storage, I can't imagine needing more space ever, really. I'm really enjoying the phone, it's nice to hold even with a case, it's lightweight and pleasant to view and type on. I don't imagine myself getting another phone for at least 5 years. It is an absolute powerhouse of a buy, highly recommend.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I love the size.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The touchscreen is flaky. I hope a software update fixes it, or that it's just my specific unit. It varies between annoying and frustrating. It's great otherwise though. Also the screen aspect ratio is wider than most YouTube videos and all HDTV so that's not so nice. The camera is perfect as usual with pixel phones.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I really like that it has many features and options. many of them are quite surprising. However, it can be a little more difficult to navigate than I like. It is also to easy to swipe things away when your intentions are to navigate to another text, scroll up or down and choose an item when working with one hand. Going back to a previous page is also tricky at times. It really is a very good phone but can stand some improvements.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was sure that Amazon Warehouse goods are tested and works fine but it's not. I sure nobody even turn it on. Camera is one of the most significant part of device doesn't work at all. No fix for this. Sure you can send it back to Amazon and maybe they will sell it again. Why not? I live in central Europe, so i used reshipper to get this phone. Spent about 70$ for get it here + local taxes. Will spend another 20$ for delivery to US. Almost 100$ loss because someone didn't do his work.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"You know the scam on the street when someone tries to direct you to a certain store to buy garbage items so that they can get a kickback? Yeah, it's like that. Was using the Honor 6x with Android 7. Was excited to get the updated system. Sorely disappointed! What have done Google?!? So much bloatware on this. Everything has some ad you cannot get rid of (I'm looking at your Print store ad in G Photos here!) Terrible photo/file management. Very poor notification management. When I open my phone, I want to see MY stuff, not YOUR garbage! The app icon management leaves MUCH to be desired. Messaging? What a crowded bunch of ""enhanced"" options. That not enhanced, it is just useless clutter. Oh look, yet another notification for Call blocking while I write this! Yep, third one today and have the notifications turned off. Not from apps I have installed but from Android itself. Glad this has a long return option as I will continue to test it out but so far...the 3 year old phone from a much-maligned company has you BEAT! (and it was $100+ cheaper!)",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The phone works so fast for what paid for I’m so happy with the phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
great for daily use,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Exactly what I wanted after having the OnePlus 7 pro. Small is so nice and light. Everything works as it should. Excellent value.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great camera! Plastic body makes the phone thin and light.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"If you don't care about all the bells and whistles, this phone is freaking awesome. The fingerprint reader works well and fast. Like many others, it does have issue if your fingers are wet but this is expected. The camera is awesome. Since processor is a tad slow, it takes like 2 seconds to process but it doesn't bother me. If you haven't tried astrophotography it'll amaze you. Even my eyes cannot see things clearly but with just a touch of light this phone can take a picture like it's under afternoon light. For everyday use it's sleek and fast enough, i never have a problem. Coming from ip x I'd say this phone is wonderful!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Worth the money! Super awesome,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Good smartphone for real life.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I love this phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The best phone pictures are beautiful..Super long lasting battery. No cons,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Day 1: Unboxing and installation So far so good. It's nice to have a clean phone. Coming from a OnePlus 5T, I sort of am estranged from a smaller size phone. It's big enough but I need to adapting. Fingerprint reader works superb, everything is a smooth install experience. The only downside so far is the thickness of the case but it feels classy and good. The phone without the case is a nice feel. Definitely not a fingerprint magnet. And WOW! My thumb can reach the whole screen again after so many years. An update on camera and software will follow, but there is no bloatware which is very pleasant.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"With this phone, the hardware and the software are allowed to integrate into their perfect potential. Google being the creator of both is likely what makes this phone better than its (overpriced) competitors. I haven't had the phone for quite a month yet, so I'll update this review if I need to. Here's where a more ""budget"" phone surprisingly stands out: 1) The speaker has more clarity versus that of the Note10+. 2) The fingerprint reader on the back has a much higher success rate than the Note10+'s (in regards to accuracy). It is also easier to physically use. 3) Google kindly allows for the bootloader to be unlocked. So if you are feeling bold, you can load on a custom ROM. (Who knows? Maybe that would help you learn to love coding; it did for me.) 4) Insane battery life. I charge it every other night. And this isn't with light use; I'd say the same might be true for you. 5) The ergonomics of the phone make it easy on the hand to hold. It rarely falls out of my hand, unlike the Note10+. It really should get a star off for not being water-resistant, and another half-star off for not supporting wireless charging. But it's just such a well-performing machine that I refuse to subtract anything from my rating. TL;DR - This is the closest Android you can get to what makes an iPhone so special, which is the hardware and software being tightly integrated from the factory.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This phone is literally the best phone I have ever had. Exceedingly amazing in every way. The camera is superb,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm glad to have a pure Android experience again with no carrier bloatware and no stupid system modifications from manufacturers like OnePlus. (They are the worst manufacturer in terms of needlessly killing background apps). The camera is fantastic! It's half because of the software and half because of the large pixels in the sensor. It's great in low light. The Night Sight mode is so much fun! On a tripod or some other stable surface, astrophotography mode will engage in Night Sight mode that allows for amazing star photos. The real-time HDR adjustment and preview is really nice. Basically, you tap on some portion of the photo to choose what you want the primary exposure to lock onto (like the bright part of a sunset) then a slider appears that lets you control the fill light. It's wonderful! It got the Android 11 update immediately after I bought it, so that's cool. Lots of nice little updates in that. The default gesture navigation doesn't work well with 3rd party launchers. (I use Nova Launcher). When I swipe up to go to the home screen, I can't tap any icons for 1 second. They don't respond. It's weird. But with the old school 3-button nav it works fine. Swiping up from the bottom also appears to choose the 3rd party launcher and if it were an app, then it reopens it. That might be part of that problem. Neither of these things happen with the default launcher, but that launcher wastes so much space on the clock and the search bar, so I don't like it. The CPU/GPU is plenty fast for me. I don't play much mobile gaming. Just some board games sometimes. The AI in Waterdeep takes it's turns quite a bit faster than on my old OnePlus 3T, so that's nice. Headphone jack and fingerprint reader are a huge plus for me. You get a lot of phone for the price!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Big android fan here. Phone is snappy and camera does not disappoint. Battery lasting a day+ for me. Very light and pocketable.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Just received this phone. It is smaller than it is described, and it is not compatible with most universal charging cables. It does not come with a SIM CARD to Activate this phone it will port your information from your current phone to this one but it wont activate unless you purchase one online or at the Sprint/T-mobile Store. We made and appointment and it did not take long to activate. The phone is fast and has tutorials to learn to navigate the phone. It will take a little time to get use to as it is not like the S 6789 10 series. The other negative is it doesnt fit with any covers so have ordered 3 different types and hoping the 3rd one fits. Jury still out on this cell!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Overall, this phone is very unintuitive. There's no back button so it uses the screen edges, you'll constantly find yourself going Back when you're just scrolling around. You have to swipe up from the bottom to check your apps, you also have to swipe up to check recent apps, besides these 2 instances fighting each other, the phone likes to ignore your swipe as well The phone is also very slippery but cases are hard to find. Like most phones, this one bugs right the hell out when exposed to rain. The pros, call screening and night photos are actually great. Overall I do not recommend buying this phone. If you have been disrespected by samsung or apple, try an LG or a 1 plus. Google is not as intuitive with it's own software as you might think.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pros: Well balanced hardware, its snappy and responsive. 6GB of ram have been paired with a processor that can use them. Has a good camera, though I really should snap more pictures and videos with it. front facing camera is great for video calls. Of all of the phones that I have used this is the best in that category. Cons: the UI has a learning curve to it. so take the tutorial. Though this is a new feature with the current Android OS, there is no back button. Yeah I know. I miss it too. there is no slot for a micro SD card. Not a problem if you use the cloud to back them up, but I don't always go were I have a data connection, plus I like to move my videos between devices. And the front facing camera feels off. I personally like the centered punch out cameras on the LG and Samsung phones that I have used. Overall. this is a good value. Even with the arrival of 5G network on the horizon. I recommend this as it fits in the palm of my hand. Has a well matched processor and ram configuration and has 128GB of storage. which should be enough for most users. the front facing camera works really well on video calls even in low light. And the WiFi radio has a good to great range, depending on frequency used.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I am still learning to use this and it has been a challenge. Not a hard or bad thing, just new. Heads up. It is very narrow. There seems to be no middle ground with phone size. I think while some challenges still remain I am going to enjoy this phone. The prices was good although the built in obsolescence of phones needs to be looked at. I still have a 18 year old one used asa ""gamer"" by little ones.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Utter crap!!! If I wanted a camera I'd buy one. Only positive thing Con is everything else: no customizable home screen and UNUSABLE SPEAKERS. I need to actually use the phone for business calls. They're staticy, have feedback and you can't hear who you're talking to. They can't hear you either. If all you ever use is camera and text itight work for you. If you actually need a phone it's garbage. Did some more research and found I'm not the only one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone for my mom. She likes it a lot!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I don't think you can find a better phone for the price. Running Android 11 with little/no bloatware, the screen changes are fast and snappy. Photos are excellent, weight is lighter than my previous Pixel 2 XL. I'm enjoying the quality. Highly recommend a case... I purchased a Poetic case.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Best Google phone, new and sealed, recommend it to everyone - 5 stars",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone worked good for only two weeks, then it would not ring anymore, then I notice that the volume of the phone was very low and I could barley hear the other person talking. This is a big issue for me because I use it for business, so I would miss all my calls and the sound for incoming text was not working either. I tried to fix the issue and I found out from doing my research on the internet that this is a major issue for this phone( Google Pixel 4A). If would of knew that, then I would off not bought this phone. The reason I bought this phone because it was small and compact. But I had to buy another phone that would ring so I could answer my calls for business. I would not recommend this phone to anybody because this seems to be a major issue for this phone. Save your money and bough another phone that will not give you any issues.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is clearly an excellent phone. But if you don't know how to use it it is worthless. And trying to get help from Google is an exercise in frustration. Everyone else in my family has iphones so they cannot help me. And despite spending hours on chats with the Google Pixel help people, I still cannot set up this phone to work in a way that is good for me. And the five icons on the home screen keep changing on their own and I don't know how to stop them from doing that and its driving me crazy. I wish I could just delete them.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is my second Pixel phone, I bought this to replace my 3A just to get more memory, and gave the 3A to a friend. I think there is an advantage to buying the phone made by the same company that makes the operating system. You get updates first and everything in the Android system works perfectly for the most part. The camera is really quite amazing for a single lens camera. Extras like Google lens which lets you photograph anything and turn it into a web search is great. My only complaint is the voice to text function for texting is not very good. I had a low priced LG that worked far better in this area. I constantly have to go back and make corrections and replace misheard words. I have searched for a solution to this problem and have not found it. That is my only complaint. Otherwise I love the phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Long lasting battery, works well with T-Mobile, amazing video and picture quality. Light phone. Might buy a second just for video production because it's much cheaper than an iphone or galaxy. So happy I bought this and saved money. Only drawback is sweeping left to go back. This doesn't take away from how awesome the phone is, but it sometimes gets annoying when you are trying to look at a webpage and accidentally go back.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

i love the phone but was disappointed to find out it was a CDMA signal phone and bigger disappointment was the lack of a micro cd connector. a 300+ phone and too cheap to add a 3 dollar slot to upgrade storage. Very sad. both of these faults were not discussed or revealed except maybe in very very fine print i never saw,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I've had the phone for just a few days and it keeps shutting off for no reason.and then the ringer keeps going back to no ringer on all my calls for no reason save your time and do not buy this phone!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"More than I expected, just $350?. Pixel person forever",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Though it's a budget phone, this has to be the greatest smartphone purchase I've ever made. The fingerprint reader is great and in a good position, the camera is awesome, it's unlikely to break from a fall because of the plastic, the set-up was easy and there's no bloatware, the offline transcription works wonderfully, and most unexpected of all... with my normal usage, this phone's battery easily lasts 48+ hours. Sometimes it's two and a half days before I have to charge it. That's *insane*!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This phone doesn't work constantly says no service it freezes videos don't play unless they are all pixelated and it won't charge most of the time I would like them to send me a new phone because this one I have had activated less than a week never dropped and it has all sorts of problems,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone, but the vibration settings are poor at best. I can only see one setting and it is next to non-existent. I would not have purchased if I had known. But if you don't need that feature, great phone. Not sure who does not need the vibration function.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"First off, I just wanna say that this view is from the point of view of an AVERAGE BUYER. All the reviews by people who review phones for a living are not accurate for someone like me to decide if I want to purchase this phone. These people are way harsher than the average smartphone buyer! Some people say this is a “budget” phone, but this is the most expensive phone I’ve ever owned. A lot of thought went into buying it, and I’m so glad I did! Camera: WOW. Just wow! This camera has the cleanest and sharpest image I’ve ever seen in person on a smartphone. I’m attaching some of my favorite photos it’s taken. So much DETAIL!! I included some photos of my dog and cat because I absolutely LOVE the amount of detail. And one photo of people to see how the selfies look!! Battery life: this phone’s battery life is very impressive. I usually only charge my phone over night so it’s ready to go the next day. I have owned this phone for almost 4 months and I have yet to charge it more than once in a 48 hour span. And the charger that comes with it charges my phone SO FAST. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Size: I absolutely love how much smaller this phone is compared to the past 4 phones I owned! It’s still a decent size but it actually fits in my jeans pocket. The screen size makes up for it because it takes up literally the entire front of the phone. Overall: I know this review lacks a lot of key features for this phone and it definitely doesn’t do it justice. But overall this phone is amazing and I would buy it again. This is my first Google phone and I’m impressed! Go for it!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Don't buy this! worst phone ever.. Bought two of these just two weeks ago and within the first week, the first pixel phone suddenly starts flickering while i was scrolling through, it turned bright purple then the screen went blackout. The 2nd one was accidentally dropped, while grabbing the keys from pocket. Both pixels screens blackout and ph doesn't work. Waste of money smh",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Best Phone ever,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Coming from a flagship iPhone 11 Pro, my standards were high. I switched to Android because Google Fi WiFi calling was not available on iPhone. My initial impression was that the phone felt cheap because of the plastic body, but it is justified because of the price tag. +The build quality is great +Screen resolution is not as good as the iPhone, but good enough if you're just going to be watching YouTube videos and using social media. -I believe the battery size is larger than the iPhone 11 Pro, but I feel like I have to charge more throughout the day. This might be because the adaptive battery feature needs to learn more about my usage. -Auto Rotation is not as good as the iPhone. It takes longer to auto rotate. Sometimes it just doesn't rotate at all. Overall, I can't complain about the phone with such a low price tag. It works well and takes good ""point and shoot"" pictures.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Nice features for a phone that gets the latest version of Android OS. Can't beat the price vs features for this phone at this time.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone, good battery life, fingerprint works very well unlike other phones, camera quality is great and the phone is very easy to activate, just pop any carrier sim card in and you're ready to go",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My Pixel 3a charging cables don't work on Pixel 4a... So I need all new accessories? Fingerprint scanner is an improvement over 3a. SMS texts stopped coming in for two days because Google broke them. Play store glitches while trying to download the apps, so why can't Google allow straight up APK transfers instead of forcing you to re-download everything on weak signal? Google is just going downhill. A lot of the apps are glitchy and slow on pixel 4a. It's not a noticeable improvement over the pixel 3a, although I have not tried the camera yet. Heck to all the engineers designing things that need internet connections... No good offline modes anymore... I can't even play GTA v on my PC offline without it wanting to authentication key online. Hate!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It was exactly what I expected, just like the previous Spigen cases I've used. In the past, I tried other brands of cases but always came down to using the Spigen. They are plain, simple, comfortable, and do what they are made for. This time when I got a new phone, I went straight to the Spigen because I knew exactly what to expect, which is nothing fancy, but effective.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is pretty good overall. I don't like that you can't assign different notifications sounds or ringtones to different contacts. There's also no notification light. Speed is good and so is the camera. However the screen was cracked within two weeks. Other phones I've had have taken far more abuse and never cracked. This was a drop of about 1 foot. It was in a case. You could blame the case for not being very protective. But what really bothers me is that it can't be repaired. At least I've not been able to find a cell repair place that's able to work on this phone. For the price it's a good deal, but I wish they would have installed a more durable screen.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm happy, fast, nice design and a lot tools.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
As soon as i powered it on it asked me to update software and restart. So i did and it never booted back on. Returning it right now,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The battery sucks. It drains so fast. If it had a bigger battery it would be 5 stars,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"All around its a solid phone, but it has a huge flaw. It overheats too fast. I used the video call and within 18 mins to 25 minutes it got hot. It even turned off on me I thought maybe the battery has died, but once i restarted the phone it told me the phone had overheated thats why it turned off. I also had a lot of audio call issues with multiple people. I return it ,but if the heating issue wasnt there I would have kept it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Screen is nice. Nice size. Not bloated. Battery easily lasts over a day for my casual use. I turn it off at night. Nice to get the OS updates before other Android cellphone mfgs. You can't remove the Google search bar at the bottom of the home screen so I installed Evie. Reception is average (better would be nice). It has the headphone jack but the sound quality is like, why bother, compared my LG V20. I'd much rather have a micro SD slot than mediocre audio and use a USB dongle. But then I'd probably want a bigger battery and complain about the size/weight.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Picked one of these up after T-Mobile upgraded their network and forced me to upgrade from my beloved Nexus 5. the plastic construction doesnt bother me, since it lives in a thick case. Overall size is on par with the Nexus 5, but with a way larger screen. Sound is decent, battery life is like 3 days of occasional youtube videos, setting up apps and a lot of standby. The camera is outstanding, the headphone jack is a nice to have and the overall construction is spot on. Great for a one handed sized smartphone. Biggest complaints are the lack of wireless charging and how annoying it's going to be to dismantle if i need to replace the battery in a few years, but as a replacement to my 7 year old workhorse, it's looking pretty good.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Im not here to review Pixel 4a, plenty of youtube videos for that. Product was not in plastic wrapping. More like Open Box, but seems to be unused. Satisfied.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
1 drop no cracked screen and had a case on it no SIM card will read anymore at all I’ve only had this phone not even a month and it already is screwed up in some way don’t buy Amazon refurbished phones as main phones. It’s just a rip off,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is a very good phone for the price. Does everything I want or need it to. Only two ""downsides"" I could complain about is that when playing some games the phone eats thru power and gets hot. And I miss the fingerprint reader.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I finally switched from Samsung and Motorola phones to a Pixel. I had read a lot of websites extolling how good of a price it was based on the features and decided to give it a chance. Overall, I would say that it is worth the money, but, having it for a few days now, there are some obvious pros and cons. Pros: Definitely the price 3 years of software support/upgrades Not full of bloatware Cons: The camera takes great pictures, but the software is lacking so every time that you take a picture and want to see it, you need to wait 5 seconds before the phone processes it. There is no wireless charging. There is no facial recognition. The sound was a real letdown. It is not nearly as loud and clear as similarly price phones. The screen is a bit small and the actual body of the phon doesn't seem as solid as I have come to expect from similar phones. I definitely think it's in the above average range based on the amount that you are paying. But, keep these cons in mind and add in that soon Google will be releasing the 5g versions which this one is not.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone came in the best condition in all respects, Amazon always insists it is irreplaceable. I have a small note about battery life, but this is more of a Google pregat than Amazon",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love it so much, I have the pixel 2 before, the new phone have a bigger screen But the phone have a weird things, the app logo have been flow on the top of the screen",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have had my previous phone for a long time and it's just begun to go wonky. I know old phones create a problem at disposal for our planet, so I have been holding onto the old one for many years. In fact, it was my first mobile phone. So switching to a new phone for me is similar to buying a 2015 car with computer and electronics vs my 20 year old car with none. I expect I will be using this for some time without having a clue how to use all its features. So I will just address the basics. The power button is in a horrible place and I am forever hitting it. So that sucks. It is thankfully silver, so at least it is easy to see. And the phone is motion activated, so having the screen light up on pick up is a feature I can get used to fast!👍 Screen resolution is a huge improvement as are many basics. Just had my first spam call and was delighted to have the option to reply with Google's spam filter and messaging that asks the caller to leave their id and message. I saw it in real time as text to confirm it was a caller looking to sell something. The ring tones are nice too, the message function kinda clunky, system settings were difficult to find, so much so I eventually created a desktop shortcut to access them. The recorded audio quality sounds muffled (when I set up my vm message) and the camera, which I though would be exceptional, oddly interprets some colors. I use it to post pics of my paintings to Instagram, and it couldn't tell the difference between teal and blue. Battery life is good. To transfer data between the new phone and the old was a pain because only after contacting tech support did I find out the enclosed usb cable ONLY works between Pixel phones! They really should include info like that with the cable/instructions and alert you when you buy. I had to buy a new cable for this one time use and wait until I had it in hand before I could transfer my contact list, etc. This phone cost me more than my Dell desktop computer and large screen. I think it's highway robbery what this and other even more expensive phones cost, but it is what it is. The position of the on switch exactly where you hold it, really is lousy design that I have to deal with every time I pick it up.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought the Pixel 4a after using a Pixel 2XL for two years. There are a lot of wonderful features within the 4a, but I am just not as impressed with it as I was hoping. For the price, it is a stellar phone. It's fast, it's pretty, it doesn't look as cheap as it is, and I honestly can't say anything back about it - besides 2 things. Even after using my 2XL for two years, the battery life is still better than the 4a. I find myself charging the 4a several times a day, whereas I rarely had to charge my 2XL once thought the day. Also, the camera. It is SO fuzzy with the front camera, and the rear camera honestly didn't blow me away. I'm a professional photographer, so I'm a bit snobby about the camera on my phone. Honestly the battery life for the 4a is just okay. If you want a cheap, high quality phone that packs a punch and a half, get this one. I personally am returning mine and buying the 4XL in hopes I'm more satisfied!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Highly recommended. Easy to use, great battery life, great camera, up-to-date and clean version of Android without the usual manufacturer bloatware. One downside is that it doesn't have an SD card slot, but I'm finding the 128gb builtin storage is more than enough for now. I bought this as a replacement for a Motorola Moto Z2 Play phone after the front glass started to separate from the frame. The Motorola was a little bigger than the Pixel 4a (and a little unwieldy if the truth be told) but to my mind the smaller size of the Pixel 4a makes it easy to handle, certainly one-handed. Though smaller in overall size the whole-screen display of the Pixel 4a seems to be about the same size as that of the Motorola and I find it runs a bit faster than the Motorola too. Overall very pleased with the new phone .",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Love my new phone. It was so easy to switch everything over.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I like the size and the battery life of the phone. The screen is extremely sensitive so when online it can change the page easily or it can hang up during phone calls.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"This phone for one thing has an awesome camera which I use for everything. I was getting so used to not getting clear sharp or correctly exposed photos with the Moto I had before. I struggled to get a clear closeup or sometimes even distant photos with the Moto. With this phone I am amazed, I get nicely exposed and clear pictures in all light levels. I use my phone to document items and even documents using the photo scan app and it works perfectly. I couldn’t have done that with Moto it just wouldn’t happen the camera and app on Motorola is horrible and I got no help from Motorola at all it’s a defect numerous people have. With this camera I have none of that the pics are just crystal clear and I don’t have to stand on my head and pray just for a good pic. Thanks Google. I like google everything it just works! Thank you! I can get perfect pictures for my reviews on Google maps and Amazon etc. I couldn’t do that before! The camera is important to me because I don’t carry my big digital camera anymore it’s just to much hassle. I want a nice clear picture taking camera that’s easy to use and quick! I use the camera more than phone calls and text so I really love this phone! I find that the camera functions can do very extensive things and for once they are easy to use which I didn’t have before. Google please keep it up make a camera that is good and easy to use and just works! I haven’t commented on the actual phone functions as I just live for the camera! I use it to document my old pictures and convert them to digital and store them on Google Photos, love it. I’ve done the old way trying to store on a desktop computer on hard drives, discs and flash drives and a scanner. Not anymore I had to re digitize my old paper pictures to google and I can access them effortlessly using Google Photos. I’m sold, I use Google for everything now. I’m 65 and this digital apps, camera phone and Google pics is just so much easier to do. The camera itself works excellent and menus are so much better and easier to use. I will probably be back to revisit this review as I discover more things about the Pixel 4a. Thanks again for a good phone at a reasonable cost.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"An important smartphone release at a time when there seems to be a real shift away from flagship devices and a move toward mid range value propositions. And with the global economic challanges ahead, the release of the Pixel 4a could be a watershed moment. The form factor is ideal for me. Whilst I understand the benefits of larger screens, the tradeoffs are too big IMO. The 4a is just so easy to handle and carry and it is so light! The pure Android is a plus. I have had bloatware on my previous two devices (Huawei) so it is a welcome change. The option to 'pause' apps is great too. Battery is good. Easily a full day. I now have battery saver mode set to auto-enable at 75% and can get 1.5 days of moderate usage. I have not had a chance to use the camera much at all but can say that the colours are an improvement over my Huawei P30 and so is the video stabilization. The P30 has an excellent camera with some advantages over the 4a but I like the results from the 4a more. As an aside, the P30 was a form favourite of mine, the best smartphone I had owned. Ticked a lot of boxes including its compact for factor. It edges the 4a on performance (the 4a does suffer from occasional lags and stutters) and has a few extra features like face unlock and onscreen fingerprint reader. But the 4a has nudged in front of the P30, albeit only slightly. Anyway, I am sold on the 4a. It delivers in spades. I don't need wireless charging nor do I drop my phones in water. I don't need a 90+hz display (the 4a's OLED display is excellent BTW) nor do I need facial recognition. I like having the option of a headphone jack though and I like having extra money to spend on other things in life. I have purchased the Spigen Rugged Armour case which provides excellent protection.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I switched from an iPhone and didn't know how I would like android, but was able to set all of it up and transfer my contacts and data easily! I am not the most tech savvy person, and even though I have had the phone for just a few days, it has been very user-friendly. The phone itself came in perfect condition; there were no scratches, everything was packaged pristinely, and I have absolutely no complaints!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
For 350 this is a great phone. Immense value,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
after one month stopped working good also all pixel phones have a terrible white bar screen bleed on the top of the screen with dark wallpapers issue still not resolved.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm not a fan of this phone. Might return it, but what a hassle! It’s a good-looking and comfortable phone. Battery lasts for about 4-5 days. And it was much, much cheaper than other phones. (hmmm, wonder why?) First and most importantly, it constantly tell me I have no signal. I haven't moved, and have been with my carrier for many, many years, and this phone is the only phone that can't find the signal. Constantly. As in most of the time. Usage is not intuitive. It does many other very annoying things, and I can’t figure out how to make it stop doing the very annoying things. I went online for a user manual and the link sent me to a site to set up your new Pixel. Um, already done – where’s the user manual? There is no user manual – too bad, so sad. Also, a search of google, ironically, reaps no results on how to make the very annoying things stop. It is possible this phone is customizable, but you have to be a google master phone engineer to figure it out, and they’re sure as stuff not going to tell you. Bottom line for me was money. Calls generally work ok, as does text. But email? Holy C, you'd think I was asking it to do something easy! I have to slog through a full crap-load of automatic and unwanted questions (can’t answer the call without a question about contacts, can’t read a text without question about contacts, etc.) before I can do the common things. I do wonder if google even knows you can do that later IF you want to at all? So annoying! I also wish it had a home button as I'm forever accidentally calling people when swiping up which, as far as I have learned to date, appears to be the only way to get to the home screen and jumps right through contacts. Also have to go to home screen if I send an email because it kicks me out. If I want to read and respond to the next email, gotta start anew from the home screen. Stupid. Would not buy this phone again, although I think google could easily fix the operating system. I wonder if they ever will, though. Doubt it. Very disappointing.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"After 3 weeks with this phone, I really wanted to like it, it is just too small for my hands, and I have a hard time reading things, I have went back to my oneplus 7 pro. Battery life was AWSOME!! 8+ hrs screen one time on a charge, if I used it normally it would last more than 24hrs on a charge. love the basic Android, and the fingerprint scanner was FAST. I guess it's just not for me",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Best phone over ever owned and couldn't imagine what I would get out of spending 3 times as much. I can't justify spending$1200 to get a better waterproof rating or wireless charging. You hardly have to charge the thing to begin with. The fingerprint reader is awesome to replace passwords on my financial apps that I prefer not to have memorized. The camera is awesome and the night sight is a cool feature. The battery lasts almost 2 days and charges to 100% in 90 minutes. There are a ton of technical reviews on the tech websites so I'll end it here,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I'm not a big cell phone fan & refuse to ""get hooked"" to a cell, so I'm in no rush. I assume it's a good phone but not a good person to ask.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought this to replace my 3 year old Pixel which won't hold a charge. It arrived quickly in great condition. Set-up was easy by simply swapping the SIM card from my old phone and using the cord to transfer data. Battery life is great so far and I have no complaints about the phone. One note is that is charging cord is about 6-8"" shorter than my old USB-C that came with my old pixel, so I'll be using the old one and buying a longer cord for charging at night.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Coming from a Pixel 2 I had concerns whether the 4a would be at all quicker. Well it is somewhat--I can play games such as Temple Run 2 on higher detail settings with no sluggishness. Overall this phone is nice and quick and everything I need. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the rear fingerprint reader (the lack of which is a big reason why I did not upgrade to the Pixel 4 in 2019). So happy that Google brought it back in 2020. Battery life so far is great, going well over 20 hours before getting to where I feel safer plugging it in. My use is lighter than probably most people, but it's at least as good if not better on battery life then my Pixel 2 under the same usage.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

It can also last without the charge within that time frame. Wonderful sound quality too, which I was apprehensive about at first since my last phone was very popular for it's great sound quality. I dig the customizable interface/themes for your phone. Previously had the ZTE Axon 7, a new Asian tech brand that lasted me a solid 3 years before deciding on this new Google Pixel 4a.

"Not a huge leap from a Pixel to a Pixel 4a. That's how I like it. This is my first new phone in many years. I had been buying used off of ""that other site"" as I didn't like buying from the carriers. You get so much crap on the phone when you buy from them, and they're not any cheaper. This was actually about $30 cheaper than brand ""V"". This is fast, the battery life is great, and it functions so much like my last one that there's almost no learning curve. I don't care about a lot of fancy things, or super duper camera and all that. If I want to take serious photos, I have a DSLR for that.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I had the Pixel 3a XL prior to ordering this phone, but my wife needed a better phone, so I ordered this one and gave her my 3a XL as she wanted the larger size. My biggest concern was the screen size difference, but with the slim bezels on the 4a, the overall screen size is really not much different when compared to the 3a XL. You can see a slight difference when you hold them side to side, but in practical terms of use, its very neglible. As for the phone itself... I love it! It has the awesome camera I have come to love with the Pixel lineup, the fingerprint reader is still in place, it has more memory and RAM than the prior model and the size is much more manageable than the 3a XL was. While I do have very large hands, the smaller physical size of the phone is just much easier to handle, and much easier to operate one handed. Prior to my Pixel 3a XL, I had the Huawei Mate 10 Pro - which I absolutely loved. I have also had Nexus and Galaxy phones, as well as a few other more budget friendly phones. For the MONEY - this phone is an absolute slam dunk! Everything you need, nothing you don't. Full Transparency - I am not a gamer, so I can not attest to how it holds up in heavy gaming. But beyond that, it works wonderfully. If there is any downside, it is the battery. Not that it's small... I have gotten through all day on more than one occasion. However, with my slightly more than average use, I do find myself needing to top off late in the evening. The good news is that in as little as 15 mins, this thing will charge up 50% or more, so it's not a huge deal. If you are going to go out for the evening, just plug it up while you are getting ready, and you'll be more than good to go! They claim that the adaptive battery software will continue to optimize the phone's battery life over time, so we'll see how that goes. But despite that, it is still a phone I would recommend ALL DAY LONG, especially when comparing to other phones in this price point. Oh, and having just one color choice?? What does that really matter, especially when virtually all of us put some sort of case on the phone. There's a good variety of cases to add color, so don't let that stop you.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
the best of google in many years.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Upgraded from a Pixel XL. For 350.00, you are getting a great deal if you are an Android/Google fan. Huge upgrades and the full face screen is just a nice upgrade. Battery life is perfect and camera take the signature Pixel quality. I wanted to wait for 5g but circumstance forced me for the 4g. I don't rely on data as much since I have wireless access wherever I go so if 5g is something you need then get the 5g version. If you are budget minded and don't care then this is a no brainer purchase.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I always buy budget friendly phones, the Pixel 4a by far has exceeded my spectations. Great adaptive battery life, small size for better one hand operation, beautiful pictures, overall a great phone. I've never own any of the Pixel line phones before and I'm regretting not trying them sooner.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Amazing phone I was stuck on the same phone for 4 years and I wanted to get something thing new. And this phone does not disappoint. All the reviews are exactly what I imagined. Amazing battery life, fast charge, and we'll pixel camera is just on another level. I highly recommend if your trying to upgrade with out spending so much on flagship phones",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I love this phone my second wife,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"What a great phone at a reasonable price. Caveat, this is the first new smart phone I've ever bought. I've had tier 1 smart phones before but had always refused to pay the full price, > 2x the price of this phone new. Thank you Google for producing a reasonably priced phone with great features.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I had a pixel 3a for a long time. It’s now my toddlers. He drops it throws it spills food and drinks on it and it’s still in perfect working order. I’ve had the phone (4a)for less than six months. Power button stopped working last night and today it shut off fully charged and won’t charge won’t turn on. Google said I can bring it in to potentially be fixed free of charge if they determine there’s no damage. The only certified places to get it fixed are over an hour and a half away from my house. Not impressed with this phone. Would definitely not buy again. Will be switching back to iPhone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Bought for wife. She likes it and adapted to it very easy. She does not like change so changing from Pixel 3a to 4a was big for her.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
My husband loves his new phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Best phone on the market. Perfect size and features for the general user. Feels like an iPhone for build quality. Internal speakers are clear and sound quality. Couldn't ask for a better value.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Does everything I wanted it for. Camera is great! I was a little concerned about the demo sticker but google said the sticker was a error.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4a is right in the sweet spot of performance and price. The camera is amazing with the update that Google just released in the beginning of November '20. Six gigs of RAM means that apps don't have to fight for resources, making it a pleasant experience to listen to music or podcasts while gaming.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Perfect size for mom as she doesn't want something she can'tr fit in her pocket. Works great and she likes it.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The odd no button-button takes some getting used to. Even after several months it might take an extra try or two to get it to do what I want. The side button works only when it wants to so to restart the phone or to lock it takes several tries. The rest of the options are great! The photos it takes are better than any phone I have seen.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I got this 4a to replace a older Pixel XL 1st edition.I was concerned I by be going sideways or down with this purchase.Camera is great and the same,the call clarity is better,it's faster browsing, and good battery.I nice bang for the buck phone and highly recommended.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I went from a Galaxy S7 to this Pixel 4A 5 days ago. So far I like it. It is very similar to the S7 in overall size, but without the bezels the screen is bigger. Most functions seem similar, I'm not sure what the raves about a ""pure Android experience"" are about. I don't trust and don't use either the facial recognition or fingerprint reader, so I just gave them a middle star rating. The speakers are loud enough for me and I have a some age related hearing deficit. I've always used an ATT store to set up my phones before, but they told me they no longer do that for unlocked phones, despite paying upfront for their network for the past 8 years. I followed Google's online instructions for transferring the data from my S7 and they worked fine. The only irritating thing was that the directions said the box contained an adapter for attaching a USB C cable to a USB micro; it doesn't. It is an adapter for connecting a full size USB to the USB C in the box. So I had to go get a full size USB to USB Micro cable. Overall, I can't see a lot of difference between this phone and my previous S7, except that I now get security updates for Android and the S7 no longer does. Why pay $700+ for a ""flagship phone"" when this does the job for half the price or much less? And 5G? Give me a break. Lots of hype and no benefits so far. I don't expect to see a benefit in my rural area for many years and it still doesn't work any better than 4G LTE in downtown Denver where my wife's office is. So, a middle of the line phone works very well and this was the best I could find for my purposes.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm not an expert in cell phones, but I really liked my earlier version of version of the Google Pixel. So after researching mid-priced phones, the 4a seemed like a good choice. It came quickly and I was able to transfer data in a reasonable amount of time. It functions well and the battery life gets me through the day without issues (I don't stream a lot, but have frequent calls, internet searches, email checks, and a get into several apps during the day). I suppose wireless charging would be nice, but not having had that before, I'm perfectly fine with wired charging. They camera works well and takes great pictures. It's fast and I will probably stick with the Pixel line.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"If you are not using this for YouTube, etc it really last for days without a charge very crazy!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"OK so i am coming from a Nexus 5X which had started to creak and so i needed a new phone and was really happy to see all the positive reviews for Pixel 4a& the fact that it is small was a major plus for me , i just got and it and in many ways it is great , the plastic actually feels premium and the screen is great . But as soon as i held it in my hand it felt a little odd ,my Nexus has a flat back and flat cut sides, this is more rounded on the edges and doesn't quite sit in the hand the back is slippery too and feels it will slip out of my hand any moment ..the aspect ratio is a bit odd too and feels narrow, with the aspect ratio the video has to be cut from sides to adjust and the beautiful screen is wasted with two wide dark bands on the side .My Nexus feels light & grippy and sits really well in my hand ...maybe i will get used to it but i wish they had kept the aspect ratio and flat sides",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone was previously owned by someone and it got blocked by Sprint. As a result, I could not activate this phone with Sprint; it is BLOCKED, because someone still owes Sprint $ for this phone. How is this possible?? Why are Amazon/Google selling phones that cannot be activated under the guise of new and UNLOCKED phone? I am returning it... Wasted a lot of time ordering, returning, and trouble-shooting with Sprint on the phone until the Sprint rep was able to figure out WHY the phone cannot be activated. This is NOT acceptable.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Nice phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Bought it to save money and for the camera. Haven't been disappointed.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This was quite a step up for me going from a HTC Desire 526 smart phone to the Google Pixel 4a smartphone. I like the fact that it is unlocked. Never buy a phone that is not. In that way you can take it to the carrier of your choice. I've been with Verizon for 4 years now. And they keep giving me perks for my loyalty so you never bite the hand that feeds you. Now about the phone itself. I like the fact it had a transfer device with it so transferring my files, pics, and contacts was very easy for me and granted I am not real techie but I can do a few things without help. I like the fact it has 128gb of internal memory so no need for an internal micro sd card. Great camera too. I like you can set it to block out telemarketers. It takes very little time to charge it and the charge lasts a very long time. 12 hours approximately depending on what you do with your phone. I am NOT a gamer as I view it as a big waste of time. The phone has limitless potentials. I like the OLED screen too. It's very light and thin which is nice. I do suggest you get a good rubber armor for it which I did. People I talk to ask me what kind of phone I am on now because I sound really good on it. You won't experience drop calls on this phone no matter where you are. I'm 68 years young and hope this will be the last phone I will ever own until the day they put me in a box. It has a great assortment of ringer sounds to choose from or if you don't want to be disturbed you can set it to that too. Great Wi-Fi too and you can turn it into your own private Wi-Fi hotspot if you choose to do so. Which I think is very cool. I don't think you can go wrong with this phone as like I said before the potentials of what it can do seem to be limitless. Also the learning curve is quite easy and it's an Android. Iphones are just a name and you pay dearly for it. I'll stick to Android phones. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a very functional and efficient/proficient phone. Buy it. You won't regret it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Best phone I've ever had!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Super fast, she is coming from a Samsung S8 and I have the S9. This phone is pretty awesome, we are willing to give up our wireless charging to have a fast phone at a cheaper price. Sucks it isn't at least water proof but we'll take that chance I guess. Anyways wife is happy and I just ordered one for myself.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm very satisfied to own this new awesome phone, Google Pixel 4a. Also, it is full Android and no bloatware. Moreover, I have no issue to use LTE while I am in Honduras. It is very handy for my needed because I usually check the news, social medias, and useful accessibility for deaf like myself. I don't really care much about High Quality Camera and I am not a heavy gamer to play on the mobile; therefore, I don't use them much at all. Overall is Amazing!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I have been using a iphone since 2007 religiously. I went and bought the iphone 12 and after a few days of using it and watching reviews I decided to finally go try a android phone. I bought the pixel 4a started using it right away I haven't picked up iphone since I got the pixel. I absolutely love it!!!! I have gone from team iphone to team pixel and I'm pretty sure this is going to be my main daily driver phone. I love everything about it. (I did just order the pixel 5) so anyone who is thinking about going from iphone to pixel DO IT!!!! The camera is amazing. The battery life is great. The phone runs very smooth and I love everything about it. I haven't found one thing I don't like yet. And being 2020 and having to wear masks the finger print scanner is a most and perfect!!!!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Doesn't send text messages consistently. Pop out video doesn't work. Native video chat doesn't recognize phone orientation.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Google claims phone battery last 24 hours, not even close. 12hours max so far with data and bluetooth turned off and shuting down some other bells and whistles. I don't use my phone much. Spotify check out FB. I haven't given the camera a test yet. I switch off the annoying gestures and put the home button on. It's easier to navigate that way. I hate that the charging cord is c to c on both ends. That means you need to take your charger with you. Stupid. Great my car has USB plugs I can't use. I looked into getting a fast-charging USB to c cord but the cord mfg didn't recommend it for the pixel lines. Btw this phone listens to you all the time. Even with google voice turned off. Spotify has crashed twice so far with this phone. I didn't have that issue with my Samsung active 7",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It really gives you that flagship experience at a pretty remarkable and competitive price point of only 349 dollars. It's a no brainer if you're looking for something more than the average $80 walmart cheapo phone. Get this phone! it very much is worth it. And personally. The lack of waterproofing for me is pointless. All my old phones where the same way. Hardly a disappointment. and no wireless charging? Eh? if it cuts off 600~ bucks off the normal 1k price tag that is something I am capable of living with. Also. 128 gb of storage means you basically never run out of space. Compared to my old phone of 12 (8 was taken up by the OS lol) it feels even better!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
My first Pixel. It won't be my last! I love this thing.. Simple operation with a great camera and the battery life is crazy good,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
So I had to send mine back because of OLED uniformity issues. One side of the screen was not as bright as the other and it had horrible black smearing on low brightness when scrolling. It also had a lot of color shift issues when just moving the phone ever so slightly. It shifted to almost all colors of the rainbow. Does anyone have similar experiences?,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Less than one month the display is falling. it is a common problem poor quality,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Not impressed just a regular phone I thought that since it was called the Google pixel it would be more surrounded around the photos app but it wasn’t so therefore I was disappointed because I was really looking forward to that,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Really like my new phone. Definitely worth the wait and money.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought this to replace an ailing LG6. I was most impressed with the setup. I did it all in the car, riding as a passenger. You just connect the old phone and the new one with a cable, switch over the SIM card, and start the transfer. It installs the phone with the new SIM card, no waiting at Verizon to do it and then paying them for the non-service. It transfers contacts, photos, and other content. All the apps are setup for transfer, but it waits until you have WiFi to start the process. Non-sensitive ones came over with passwords transferred, too. Sensitive ones, like bank card, mobile banking, and other security-sensitive apps required you to sign on again. Swiping instead of 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen finally had the best of me, but there is an option to install the traditional 3-button controls, and it works like a charm. Still figuring out some of the features, but I've very happy.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
When I play music on Pandora I have to restart the phone of sign out of pandora cannot edit contact to delete old phone number when contact gets new number cannot create personalized ring tones for contacts all ring tone files that display do not play I am most impressed with camera everything else is muah! or less,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It's plenty quick, a great form factor, and handles calls well. But the battery life is awful compared to my 3 year old OnePlus 5T. My old OnePlus can still go all day with plenty of screen time and still have 30% left by the time I go to bed, and I routinely used to get almost 2 days out of it back when the phone was new. But the Pixel 4a struggles to make it to the end of one full day even with brightness set much dimmer than the OnePlus. I would consider the 4a to be the absolute bare minimum battery life acceptable for a smartphone. I'm not commuting much anymore, but this feels like a phone that would have me stressing about making my commute home without an emergency battery pack. It's acceptable, but certainly not great.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The camera is the best I ever used, it corrects all my mistakes, lighting, shaking. When you pan the video, I don't see any distortion like all my older phones. Shockingly good camera. The lack of direct wifi hdmi to rokutv/monitor is very limiting. I wanted to use my cell as my home computer and internet data source, all in one device. There is no work around with chrome cast without a home wifi network. For rural users this may not be possible. I hope there will be an update. My only work around is to get a new plan with unlimited hotspot at 5mbs.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have used oneplus 7t pro, pixel 4 Xl, IPhone 11 pro, S20 and finally pixel 4a in that order for the past year. After using the pixel 4a for 2 days, I can easily say this is my favorite phone of the bunch. Very happy with the placement and speed of the fingerprint reader as opposed to the not so accurate one on the one plus and s20 on screen fingerprint. Very happy with the battery life, as opposed to the crappy battery on the S20 with exynos chip. My favorite camera to take photos, just like the pixel 4. Best software experience, same as the pixel 4, and finally it costs 350 dollars, which is only half the price of the least expensive phone on the list!!!! This is by far the best value for money I have ever seen in a phone. Biggest downside was the 60 hz refresh rate after coming from the 120 hz in the S20, but I can't really complain given this is marketed as a ""budget phone"". If you are just looking for the basics in a phone and want consistency, this is the phone to get.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I purchased this for a friend who didn't want to spend a bunch of money on a cellphone, but also wanted a nice camera.

"I have the original Pixel XL and almost upgraded to the 3a XL last year, but the reviews didn't convince me it was worth it. I just kept using my phone until I found what I thought would be a nice upgrade. The 4a is the right phone for me at the right time. The cost was so tempting given the specs, I didn't blink. I got it from Amazon only 3 days after official release. I love it. Nothing about it feels inferior to the Pixel XL. I was able to connect a USB-C cable and transfer my files and settings in about 20 minutes. I also connected to my main Win 10 machine and updated my music on the new phone and everything went without a hitch. I found this upgrade process so much easier and smoother than when I upgraded the two family I-phones (6+ and 7+ to 11) Christmas 2019. Once I set everything up I checked performance and found the new 4a very snappy. My use is mostly web browsing, email. news, a bit of shopping and Facebook. Nothing challenging, so I loaded up YouTube TV and watched it in small and full screen while I transferred some of the music files. I saw no slow downs in playback or the transfer. From my limited testing around the home office, the camera is pretty nice. The speakers are about on par with the original Pixel and about what I expected. The speakers sound fine. With a headphone jack and Bluetooth 5.0, better sound is simple enough to remedy. I know this isn't in depth or a long term review, but in the 24 hours I have had this phone its been great. I have gotten good battery life too. Thanks Google for a great phone and Amazon for getting it to me.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The ""Google Pixel 4a"" is super fast, and the 128 GB is the right mix of storage. This is such a significant upgrade from my last cell phone that got fried when I jumped in the pool with it, a little careless on my part, I will have to be more careful with this one. I've been using this new phone for almost a month, and I haven't had any problems. Like I wrote, it is super fast and can upload Apps in a matter of moments. Plus, if you are one for not spending a lot of dough on the phone, the cost is most fair for what you get at the end. This is a top of the line phone that is a noticeable improvement from my last one that I had help installing from a family member. Still, we got this phone running without a hitch. I would say you got to know what you are doing. Not saying anyone can do get it to run so quickly out of the box without help. Still, those are the breaks, just know if you are like me, and you do fry our phone, all is not lost if you do buy this one, and you will be somewhat better off in the end if everything goes well. Also, the battery life on this thing is a great plus as well.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"This device is unlockable - yea!!! However, you will need a type C to USB A cable if you are going to connect the phone to your PC's USB port down the road, so add that to your order (I wish someone would have told me). To unlock this phone: get your finger ready to scroll.... and 1. to get into Developer mode: go to settings - about phone - tap Build number 6 times, your phone may ask you for your pass code at this point, once done 2. Then once you are a Developer go to settings - system - advanced - developer options - then OEM unlocking :) slide the button 'on' and you should be good.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Luego de probar el teléfono una semana, mis conclusiones más relevantes (y por las cuales recomiendo este teléfono), son las siguientes: - Cámara 9/10. Sólo le falta versatilidad, en calidad visual y detalle de lo MEJOR que hay en el mercado. En video es bueno, pero se podría haber mejorado un poco más (apple sigue siendo superior en esto). - Tamaño 10/10. Muy ergonómico para el día a día, fácilmente se puede ocupar con una sola mano, liviano. - Software 8.5/10. Android de Google va muy fluido en este dispositivo, a pesar de que el chip 730G es inferior a otros (765G). Puntos positivos, los 3 años de actualizaciones, Google assistant y que no tiene app's basura como MIUI y Samsung. Sin embargo android 11 hay que mejorarlo un poco más, lo cuál es entendible ya que se ha actualizado recientemente. - Batería 7/10. Para mi uno de los puntos más ""flojos"". Google hizo una buena optimización con el consumo de la batería y se debe destacar, fácilmente se puede llegar a un día de uso (en cuarentena he ocupado bastante el consumo multimedia, YT, instagram). Sin embargo, no sé cómo se comportará en un año más, razón por la cuál hubiera agradecido tener una batería de al menos 3400 mA o más. - Diseño y Construcción 7/10. Destacar que el teléfono en mano se ve mucho mejor que en fotos, o entrega una sensación un poco más premium de lo que realmente esperaba. El acabado en plástico me da cierta sensación de fragilidad si el teléfono se llegara a caer y temo por la pantalla (espero estar equivocado). Por último, visualmente se debe mejorar, sigue siendo un teléfono poco atractivo para la mayoría de usuarios. Creo que si Google mejorara sus diseños, podrían atraer a muchos más consumidores. -Precio 10/10. A pesar del costo de envío e importación, sigue siendo mejor alternativa que los modelos que se venden en mi país (Huawei, Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, etc.) por el mismo precio.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"[May 7, 2021 thoughts on Pixel 4a, ordered November 8, 2020 and used daily ever since] PROS: Form factor and weight- This is the best marriage I have found. Fantastic screen real estate, sensible (ideal?) resolution, and just terrific dimensions for me. This thing is light weight for its size, and I love that more than I can possibly express. Hand fatigue has been all but completely eliminated. Give me plastics, baby! I have no desire for metals that don't add to functionality (and apparently, from something I saw on YouTube, this phone is insanely rugged, even with a plastic shell). Glass is always heavier and less durable than other materials choices, and it's just altogether not well suited for the backside of a mobile handset, IMO. I think Apple charges $550 to replace the back glass on most modern iPhones. This Pixel 4a is the total package and stickers for $200 less than the price of Apple's back glass repair. Price:Performance- While I can't compare this phone to another of its kind with a higher performing Qualcomm, I am never wanting for speed. This phone has been wonderfully fluid and performant for my day-to-day needs. The lean Android experience on the Pixel line really lets its mid-range Qualcomm shine. I most recently carried both an iPhone 7 Plus and 2020 SE, and both proved plenty fast for anything I do; this 4a is no exception. Background app refreshes seem to be on par with what I had using 3GB iPhones. No real surprises. My day-to-day habits seem mostly unaffected by any background app refreshes I've noticed. I think the 6GB of memory strikes a good balance for the 4a. I don't game. Well, I play some chess now and again, including occasional analysis using very demanding engines (Stockfish, etc), but in general I can't comment on gaming performance. Battery- Battery life and charging time have been lovely. I seldom charge to 100-percent, instead I prefer to just give little 5- to 15-minute charges periodically during the day, while keeping the battery in the 30- to 70-percent range where possible. This thing charges way, way faster than my older 7 Plus and 2020 SE iPhones and overall battery life is likely comparable or better from what I can gather (very unscientifically). I leave it to the readers to determine how important battery life is and do some research of their own. Camera- It's so good it doesn't even make sense. Shooting stills, the 4a smashes my old iPhone 7 Plus my a wide margin and the 2020 SE couldn't hold a candle either. I think that's being objective. I've had quite a bit of low-level, professional photography training at University level and time behind the lens of DSLRs, and I'm quite astonishing that I can get such quality images from the 4a. The software image processing is pure magic. I have kids, and they're the important subjects for me. I'd guessed the 4a might struggle with motion, particularly in lower light, which would have been a deal-breaker for me, but this thing takes ""keepers"" practically every single time. Glorious. Most already know how well Pixel phones shoot non-moving subjects, so I won't carry on about that. It's an exciting camera experience. Concerning video, the 1080p 30- and 60-frame shooting has not disappointed either, and the image stabilization is truly excellent. I don't mess with 4k on phones (yet), so no comment there. I don't take selfies, so I won't comment on the front-facing camera either. Android- The gesture navigation is fantastic, particularly the ability to go back by swiping in from either the left- or right-hand side of the display. Massively convenient and easy on the hands. Updates/security patches are crucial for me, and with a Pixel, scorching fast updates are what you get, and support duration bests most Android-based OEMs. Fingerprint recognition- Works as well and as fast as any I've experienced. Thought the rear placement would bug me. It absolutely does not. Rear placement is probably my preference now. Well executed. I like. CONS: Audio volume/intensity- The 4a just doesn't get as loud as some other modern handsets. It's tricky to listen to a podcast or whatever when I'm doing dishes, for example. That said, the audio quality is perfectly satisfactory, to me. Google Search- There's a Google search bar installed by default on the home screen. I leave mine there and find it useful. When tapped, you're presented with the ability to ""search apps, web, and more..."" (much like the search on iOS when you pull down from the top). Google/Android learns over time, so that eventually it can quickly present you with what you're most likely to want. Works great, more often than not. But the problem for me is that it's inconsistent with regards to displaying apps. It must be that about 20-percent of the time it doesn't display apps, so I'm forced to swipe up from the bottom of the display to close the interface, then tap the Google search bar again before it populates apps in the query. I can't figure out what causes this for the life of me, and I've owned an IT MSP for years, so this ain't my first rodeo with tech devices! Frustrating, but muscle memory makes this only a half-second affair to correct. Dependability- I've long used the same MVNO for cell service, which I mention only because there exists a small possibility that it's of importance here: I've found a few occasions where I can't place phone calls. To fix, for some reason, a reboot was required. I haven't had any issues in the past few months, but it's probably because I've changed habits; now, whenever there's an update to something low-level from Android (not just a basic app update), I reboot the phone. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?? Anyway, I'd have a ""need"" to reboot an iPhone maybe once every six months, outside of forced reboots from doing an iOS update. To have had to monthly (or maybe even more frequently) reboot this 4a in order to connect phone calls (with no warning as to any trouble, unless I attempted to place a call and ""connect the dots"") is unfortunate. I don't like to have to think about mitigating critically buggy behavior by rebooting my phone from time to time. OLED- I'm sensitive to flicker, so I basically hate OLED. My daily driver laptop is a ThinkPad T480s LARGELY because its 1080p IPS is flicker-free (no PWM). This 4a gives me viewing fatigue after a relatively short while. On the 4a, unless you're at max brightness (exactly 100-percent), you can expect flicker in the ~122 to 255Hz range. That's too low for me. I would prefer an LCD, like the ones I had in my iPhone 7 Plus or 2020 SE. I could view those endlessly without fatigue- read books on them, you name it. But the industry does trend, and trend it does for the contrast ratio specs and inky blacks the kids rave about these days {rolls eyes}. Overall: This is probably the finest overall set of compromises I've ever found in a cell phone, and I've owned many of them since 1994. I'm highly satisfied with this handset, and I think very little could realistically be done today to improve upon the formula that is the Pixel 4a. Google has made a proper phone for adults. 9/10 DO recommend!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"My phone died and I needed a new one fast, so I bought a Pixel 4a based on all the glowing recommendations from friends. Turns out they were talking about the 4a5G, which not only has 5g support, it is a bigger phone with a larger screen.

"Video call imagery is awful when using the front facing camera. Worse than my three year old Motorola phone. The video calls are pixelated and looks washed out. It is distracting how fuzzy it looks. I'm shocked that none of the reviews that I read prior to buying the phone mentions this. I did a quick search and tons of people have had this issue. The camera itself is fine and clear when taking photos so this leads me to think it's a software issue. I tried video calls using the built in calling app, Duo, Google Hangouts, Signal, Jitsi, and Line, all were the same blurry mess. The only app where video call was clear for me was Facebook Messenger. Guidance by support is to clean camera lens and factory reset the phone...the brand new phone I got a few days ago. Now I'm in situation where I'm determining if I should return and buy another phone or stick to pixel 4a and put up with video calls that looks like I'm using a digital camera from 10 years ago.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I rebooted but when it came back up it wanted me to enter my pin and I couldn't. I was receiving phone calls, but couldn't answer them. Screen is just completely not responsive to touch. I didn't drop it. There hasn't been water damage. Won't be getting another one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

The battery lasts all day with normal use and it charges very fast. The camera is top notch in all situations, even outside at night. So it doesn't have wireless charging capability or a telephoto lens, big deal. I don't need either. In my opinion this is a great phone and at $349, it's a steal!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Most user unfriendly phone. The fingerprint reader is awkwardly placed on the back of the phone instead of where the thumb naturally lies. The user controls for navigating internet pages and toggling between programs is very unintuitive.

"Great phone, fast ship",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4a represents exactly what every regular cellphone, to have a great phone that doesn't cost more than a PS5 or a computer. The best feature of this device is the software that is pure Android that's very easy to use and learn and the camera, which is the same as the main camera of the Pixel 4 & 4XL. There is no greater satisfaction to have a good budget phone that takes great pictures. This is the main reason I didn't go for the Oneplus Nord, because it incorporated many cameras that didn't took nice photos as the pixel even though it was pricier. In a nutshell, the Google Pixel 4a has a good software for the regular use if you don't overuse it for smartphone heavy games, a good battery that lasts me the whole day or even more, a 3 year software update warranty, and the amazing camera that comes with it!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Unbelievable value and quality for the money! I've had it for 7 weeks now. I miss a few features that my Samsung Galaxy S6 had, like the voice activated camera shutter and the Gallery. All in all one dandy phone. I would have had to spend twice the money to get an appreciably better phone. Be sure to buy a Spigen armor model ACS01015 when you buy this phone. You won't regret it. The phone IS remarkably usable without a case.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Good for everyday use.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone itself is absolutely amazing, performance is great, even though some reviewers are saying that it is falling behind some other competitors, I haven't really noticed any hiccups or lags while using the phone and apps almost always stay open in the background unless I open like 20 of them. I don't really play games on my phone but I think it will handle most games with ease unless u want to play on max settings. Screen is really really good, I came from a samsung so I know what a good amoled screen feels like and this one is great, even at this resolution the image and the color accuracy is really sharp, could have been a little brighter though, but haven't really bothered me its good enough even in the sunlight. Camera is absolutely amazing, especially at this price point, its flagship class. Night mode is absolutely amazing. Takes amazing pictures, sharp and color accurate. Video recording is great as well. The only downside can be considered the fact that sometimes when you take a pictures it takes like 2-3 second to process it, but other than that it is really really good, like one of the best. Many people say that the holepunch camera cutout is annoying, but it is in a such a spot that it disappears in use, even during watching videos and movies. I almost never notice it while watching content or browsing, unless I absolutely have to see an info that is written on that corner. Battery, the probably the only downside of this phone, you might be like why? well because it is inconsistent, it can last you with the same exact use on most days for like 6 and even 7 hours! but on others it might last 3 or 4, I don't understand why is the battery like this, from what I have researched in background it runs some kind of android system process that bottlenecks it from time to time. But overall I would rate it 4 stars, would have been 5 if it was not like this. Fingerprint scanned is, well really really fast, almost instant, but like other fingerprint scanners, if your fingers are wet it wont recognize them, but its like this on like 90% of others phones which I have used with this feature so It doesn't really bother me. Build quality is good, I don't mind the plastic back because it feels really good in your hand, its smooth and not slippery, it is really nice to hold it in hand, but as most other users I have a case on it. Other google features really make this phone a good experience, for example the music recognition and others. Overall this phone is a solid 4.7 out of 5, as I said the battery can be a mix bag but other than that it is great. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants a good phone, which has some good features, amazing camera, good battery life on most days, nice screen, good performance and solid, nice feel in the hand. Especially at 350$ dollars it is a steal.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Talk about value for your money. The interface is clean. The software is fast and liquid. No bloatwares. Amazing camera.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Their is currently a nasty bug in Android 11 that affects the Pixel 4a(Including myself). While using a screen protector, you will get phantom touches and unresponsive scrolling. Navigation gestures are unresponsive or erratic. Gesture style keyboards are nearly impossible to use. It really gets bad when the phone gets hot, which doesn't take long at all when you're using it. I've been pulling my hair out dealing with the issue. Hope a fix is coming. Been this way since Android 11 dropped. The Issue was not present in Android 10. Plus side. The camera on the phone is absolutely superb. This thing takes awesome clear crisp pictures. Fast charging and sleek body design. Doesn't feel cheaply made. Speakers are loud and the phone is perfectly sized. This will be a 5 star once Google fixes the sensitivity issue! Update: October security patch just came out and Google fixed the issue. Yaay. I cannot reproduce the touchscreen sensitivity issue.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I had the Pixel 4a for a month in late 2020, and I generally liked the phone. The most important part that makes this phone great is the price, $350. It's not going to get you any top-tier iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but it gives you everything the general user would possibly need - a decently fast Snapdragon 730G SOC, 6GB RAM, and 128GB storage. That's something that not even the $830 base configuration of iPhone 12 gets you. Of course, being $350 there are a few things that it misses out on compared to higher-tier phones. One of those things would be the plastic unibody build over something like a metal and glass sandwich. On a phone of this price point it's fine, though I did have a bit of plastic creaking near the SIM slot. It was just an annoyance at worst, because the rest of the plastic build felt fine. Wireless charging is also not present, this may disappoint some that used it but it didn't bother me cause I never used wireless charging on my iPhone 8. There's no water resistance either, which did raise my eyebrows a bit before I bought the phone but I don't submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty places. One thing this does have that the $700 Pixel 5 doesn't have is a headphone jack. So if you still use anything with a 3.5mm plug, this phone has you covered with no need for adapters! The speakers are also quite good, with one speaker on the bottom next to the USB-C port and one built into the earpiece. As for the software, it's got three years of updates which is better than many Android manufactures, but it still won't top Apple's software support. I did notice a few software bugs when I used it, mainly with YouTube Vanced's PIP mode after a certain amount of time. Restarting fixed the issue but it was an annoyance. Hopefully that was just Android 11 and that gets fixed with a future update. Battery life is also pretty decent, better than the aging battery on my iPhone 8 since I could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night. Given that it's a small phone by today's standards it's not going to be a battery life king, but it's better than the $400 iPhone SE. The size is something I loved about this phone, my hands are relatively small and I like my phone to be pocketable, which is something that I'm not a fan of with most new phones being over 6 inches in size. The 5.81-inch edge-to-edge screen Is of a similar size to my iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, thus I could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pockets. This is something I'm sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phones. The camera has been the definition of the Pixel phones since the first ones launched in 2016. This phone has an amazing single 12MP lens, mostly made great by Google's computational photography software. Night mode was very nice to use, as in the scenarios I used it in it helped out take better photos at night. I'm no expert with cameras so I don't know much about white balance, dynamic range, etc. I do like how this phone gives you one great camera as opposed to other manufacturers which give you like seven different pretty-much-useless camera sensors. Overall, this is the phone to buy if you're on a budget of less than $500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general needs. I would suggest going for the Pixel 4a 5G version if you can afford a $500 phone as that has a second ultrawide camera lens, a faster Snapdragon 765G SOC, and as the name says, 5G connectivity. That phone will overall will give you a very very close experience to the Pixel 5, but if you don't have that much to put down for a phone, and if you like the standard 4a's smaller size, this phone is the way to go. I highly recommend it and I would personally pick this any day of the week over a similarly priced phone from a China brand like Oppo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Vivo, etc.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm really enjoying the Pixel 4a. It's slightly smaller than my last couple of phones, which makes it slightly easier to hold. It's faster than my OnePlus 5T was. I like that Google supports it so much that I get early access to the newest Android releases.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"The is a great budget phone , that you cannot be mad at. The finger print reader is pretty fast and super secure. This is not a under screen finger print sensor so it unlocks you phone instantly. This phone has a surprisingly small battery but I get exceptional usage out of it. I'm up from 4 in the morning and doing my usual ig youtube emails and games I usually have 15 percent @7pm. The best thing about the phone is android 11, I am upgrading from one plus 2 with lollipop and the different in os is huge. But it runs so smooth. Apps open and work flawlessly and everything is very quick and responsive for a 350 dollar phone. The only con for me is the screen size , more specifically the width. It took a bit of adjusting from my oneplus 2 which was wider and easier to type on. I make way more typos with this to the point is use the voice typing now more than touch (which wasn't available on lollipop). Overall I am very pleased with this phone, for the money I can see myself using this until the android updates stop. I love my one plus 2 but even with that small con, I don't see myself not using this phone for a long time.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

The keyboard lags and chooses the wrong letters. I wouldn't know how the camera is considering when it is opened it freezes the phone. The fingerprint unlock is slow. The battery life is so so. I'm not crazy about the weight of the phone, it feels very light almost like I'm holding a toy phone. I'm really disappointed. This is the first AND last Pixel phone I will own. Unfortunately I will have to keep it as I can't be bothered to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for a refund and searching for a new phone.

I wanted a new phone that still have a dedicated fingerprint scanner because on screen scanner is still slow (based on 6T and Samsung S10). I want a phone that is light and small, with a good enough camera. I don't play games on my phone so I don't need no latest and greatest silicones. I don't worry about drops because it's polycarbonate, and I disliked glass backs ever since the LG V30. The Pixel 4a is simple, it's clean, it works, and it runs the latest Android. I would have wanted an even bigger battery because it would probably still be lighter than most phones. Plus it has a headphone jack.

"Great, responsive phone but it keeps plummeting! Keep it on a rough surface so it doesn't walk off on you! Not sure what is going on but I keep finding this phone on the floor. A few times I've actually caught it in the act, just slipping off a surface that I've laid it on, so I've started to put it inside a box or other lipped surface to keep it from walking off. I suspect the screen and slight lip might be enough to reduce the friction so that even small vibrations can send it off in some direction but I've never caught anything actually doing it, and I didn't have the problem with my old phone (maybe it liked me more?) It's a cute source of jokes in my house. I've had the phone for about a week and a half and so far am liking it a lot. Pros: Nice weight, good responsiveness Cons: Misinterprets light touches, turns off while looking at it. The cons might be something I just need to hunt down settings for. It seems to be over sensitive when I try to swipe. It's often drilling down to the next screen when I don't want it to. It has also shut the screen off during a few tasks, so it is a lot different than my previous phone. That being said, it has the features that I like and is wonderfully nice and responsive, even if it does like skydiving a bit too much.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

But to do this, the corners of the screen are completely rounded, which I don't prefer as much, and the front camera lens is inside the screen, which hasn't been that big of a deal. The only problem so far is once the phone froze during an incoming call and couldn't be answered, phone had to be restarted. Battery life seems ok, but have to purposefully limit was the phone automatically accesses to limit use and extend battery.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

But there are several negatives you should be aware of: Battery life - OK, but not great Processor - OK, but not great Display - looks great but there is an area about 10 - 20 pixels big all around the right edge and bottom where the phone does not register any touches. Very annoying in games and any app with buttons way at the right/bottom. The Pixel Launcher takes a huge chunk of the display for Google to use as they please (can be fixed by switching to the Nova Launched, but it's annoying to have to do that) Not water proof No wireless charging I really like the smaller size and can live with the problems for a couple years, but I'll be upgrading in 3yrs... UPDATE: Added 1 star - the biggest disappointment for me was the dead-to-the-touch zone around the edge, it turns out that was caused by Android 11 gestures. Once I changed the UI to instead use the 3 buttons (Back\Home\Nav) at the bottom, that problem went away.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The cameras on this phone are absolute trash compared to my pixel 3. Otherwise the exact same phone, not worth the upgrade.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great performance, slim outlook and huge battery capacity with low price. Can't return to another android phone once you chosen the pixel series.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have been an Android fan ever since my guest phone. I got taljed into the iPhone recently and after less than a month I just had enough. I returned it and got the Google Pixel 4a: (I have friends that have this also) BEST decision ever. Now I can use my Fitbit Versa 2 again, ALL features. I love all the features of this phone which I'm still learning. The camera is exceptional. The ""night sight"" feature is phenomenal. The price of this phone is also very appealing. I highly recommend this awesome phone. 👍👍",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4a is the best phone I've ever owned. It's performance is very good, the size is great in my hand, and the camera is really good. Even though it's only maybe 1cm smaller than other phones it really fits in the hand much better. The plain Android software works well, and it gets regular software updates. Other than that it's much the same as any other Android phone. Battery life is pretty good, not as good as phones with larger batteries but you do have to compromise a little when you choose a small phone - there's not much space for the battery in there. I charge my battery to 80% and most days with light use it's at about 40 - 50% at the end of the day. If I use it really heavily it would probably still last the day but it'd be pretty low so I tend to do a top-up charge. The supplied charger tops the phone up really quickly, which heats the phone up a little more than I'd like so I tend to use a medium speed charger most of the time, but it's great if I'm in a hurry.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Esta genial 👍🏽,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This is a great smart phone. Period Hands down the best budget phone. Unless you like a huge phone then get the 4a5g or the new yet unreleased 5A.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Is the camera super high resolution? No, but the processing is great and you don't need more than 4,000 pixels wide for social media posts. Is the battery super high capacity? No again, but I never need to charge it more than once per day, and at the end of the day I still have 20 hours of battery left. Maybe if you shoot a lot of video this phone wouldn't hold out long, but for my very average usage it's fine. Does it have a fancy glass or metal case? No, but most people with fancy looking phones put a case on them anyway. Or they crack. Does it have a punch hole camera? Yes, and here's my only major gripe. I never use the selfie camera, and Netflix seems to be the only major streaming app that can stretch to full screen. All of the other apps I have (Hulu, HBO Max, Prime Video) slam the video to the right hand side which will round off the corners of 16:9 video. The punch hole itself doesn't even bother me anymore. I just want full screen video in my streaming apps, and it's not even Google's fault on this one. The verdict is that the Pixel 4a is a solid budget smartphone. It gets regular security updates, is probably getting Android 12, doesn't have a terrible app launcher, and isn't going to crack like my glass back Motorola X4.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I am amazed by the quality of this phone, the screen colors, and the speed, overall nothing to complain about. I don't switch phones so often unless it is really needed and I think I am going to keep this for at least 3-4 years. Lacking of 5G and Wireless charging is not an issue",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone, super fast and amazing camera quality!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Got this phone last fall and it was bricked by one of Google's own android updates a couple months later. I'm still trying to get them to make good on the warranty by either fixing or replacing the phone and it's been one of the worst customer support experiences I've ever had up there with Sprint and Uber. The support people are willfully unhelpful time wasters.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is my first new phone in 6 years, and I am coming from the Apple environment. The phone itself is very sleek looking and I think is a good ""medium"" size phone. I wear women's clothing and it fits in my pocket, but it also isn't small/flimsy/too light. When turning the phone on for the first time, it prompted a great tutorial on how to use it's user interface, as well as made it easy to find when I skipped it and then wanted to look at it afterwards. Quick charge was VERY quick, under 30 mins! I have not used fingerprint reader or face recognition, nor do I plan to, so I have not reviewed them.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Small. Simple. Effective. Beautiful Camera. Works Great. Couldn't ask for a better cost effective smart phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This phone was very sketchy as soon it booted up there was a VPN software already downloaded on it and several other encrypted applications used to hide traces like DuckDuck Go and other apps to get through firewalls.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Love this phone. Google still has some work to do in terms of small bugs, but this phone is amazing! Camera quality amazing, no problem with fingerprint sensor, the speakers sound incredible(almost like a dolby enhanced speaker when full volume). I can use this phone and it lasts basically all day with heavy usage. It feels and runs like a very solid premium phone (I don't care about glass, I care about feeling of durability). I still wish it had expanded storage but was able to transfer my data fine with plenty of space. I also was worried about it not working with my carrier boost mobile but I got it to run on Sprints network!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I love how smooth this phone is! The camera meets my needs and then some. This is my first pixel and I am very happy!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is amazing! Simply put.. it’s badass! The picture quality is insane! I can’t believe all that this phone is capable of. I think the phone is perfect size. It’s surprisingly light for how much storage it has. The battery lasts so long. Seriously you can listen to music apps all day, watch as many videos as you can handle... and of course use all its other features and go without charge. It’s plugged in every night just as habit. I think you could miss a charge and totally be cool. It’s also compatible with Samsung galaxy ear buds and smart watch! I absolutely recommend this phone! Hands down you will not be disappointed! Definitely beyond five stars!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Coming from a Pixel XL v.1, this screen is actually smaller. The measurement corner to corner is not the best way, IMHO, as most companies make the phones taller to increase reported screen size. If there was a 4a XL, that would be nice, but will have to wait for the 4a 5g to see what the dimensions really are. Yes, for me, the extra money for larger XL size and 5g will be well spent.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"This phone is so easy to switch to. It's a bit of a difference to swipe instead of a home button, but it is really nice and easy to get used to. There is a tips app that helps you out and help you get used to it. I really am so glad my sister recommended this phone to me. Really happy how long the battery lasts without charging and how large memory space is. Definitely recommend this phone. Google makes things super easy!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have been using this phone for about a month now and am really happy with it. Chief among the reasons I got it was its camera reviews. It does take great pictures. In addition, Google gives unlimited back up to its Pixel phones. Battery life is solid. I charge nightly and while I drive... but it wouldn't matter. Compared to my previous Moto, this thing sips power. It has 6 gig of ram, which means it will stay speedy for a couple years. There is no external memory... but the 128 gig onboard is plenty. I bought mine unlocked (it will work with pretty much any carrier) and I use it on the Hello Mobile network (they piggyback T-Mobile). It helps to be a bit of a geek to get set up on Hello Mobile (all online, no stores) but once set up it is the cheapest out there. I get 4 lines of unlimited everything for 70 bucks a month.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Charging port was loose when it arrived. It worked great for about two days, but now it's almost impossible to charge. Recommend purchasing from a different supplier.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've had my phone a couple of months. It replaced a Moto Droid Turbo 2, which was a great phone. I chose the 4a in part because it's a smaller unit. I don't want a cigar box in my pocket. The compromise was on how narrow it is -- a bit too narrow, less screen, not as substantial in the hand. But those are tradeoffs. Nice to have a clean Android install and updates! PROS Comfortable size Good display Responsive and smooth action Battery life is excellent - I get 2-3 days but watch little video, play no games, keep location off unless I need it Camera has pretty good night mode I don't use a ""wrapper"" on my phone - it slides in/out of pocket easier ""bare"". Dropped it once, no damage. Fingers crossed. (I don't use face recog or fingerprint reader) GREAT price! CONS A bit too narrow Display is not as good as the reviews would have you believe Ditto on the camera -- I'm not very happy with it. The controls are clumsy, including the exposure hotspot. I really miss the Turbo 2's ""wave your hand"" to see notifications. Seems to me this would be easy to implement on all phones. Screen is slow to populate when booting It's probably Android or the app, not the phone, but it often plays the wrong ringtones on the alarm The only other phone I considered seriously (I looked at a lot, ""in person""!) is the Samsung S21 (not 5G) at a higher price. If I were to do it again I might be swayed to get that instead. The camera is just better as is the screen. But I'll be honest -- $349 for an unlocked 4a is hard to beat! Unless your phone is a really big deal to you, the 4a does the job nicely. One last thing: I'll never buy another locked phone again!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Solid phone for minimalist lifestyle. Nothing fancy but does everything right. Amazing and intuitive camera that finds the right shot for you super fast. Battery life lasts me a solid day with some battery life to spare with fairly heavy media consumption. The most pocketable phone I've had in quite some time even with a slim case on it. Love this phone, recommend it to minimalist types and parents looking to get their teen something nice, something with a name behind it and won't break the bank.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Don’t waste your money, iPhone se is far away better buy .

Long battery life. Great camera. Id definitely recommend to a friend.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Google has finally been able to make use of their customer feedback to create one of the most practical phones money can buy, at a price that is almost impossible to turn down. Pros: -Beautiful, bright, OLED screen that screams of a value point much much higher that where it currently sits. -Powerful camera features, especially Night Sight from its big brothers, that works fantastically in all sorts of difficult lighting conditions. -Good battery life, easily serviceable for a full day because of the efficient processor. -Great feeling and looking build (not sure what all the hype is about glass backs when plastic feels this good) -Wonderful haptic feedback and full-sounding loudspeaker -Headphone jack is back! -Rear fingerprint sensor that serves as notification pull-down -Wonderful size and form factor. I have large hands and still feel like this footprint is perfect -Very capable and efficient 730G chipset (less than 20% slower than the 765G on Pixel 5) Cons -No wide angle or telephoto lens (personally would have loved to see a 3x 12MP lens perhaps?) -No wireless charging or water resistance (though with a C - to - C cable you'd probably still be able to charge your buds) Overall, this phone get's my highest recommendation. It nails everything you need, and doesn't give you anything you don't. (OnePlus 2MP macro, anyone?) Easily the best budget phone of 2020.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Google... nada mas q decir,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Cheap inferior phone (in all aspects) except the camera. And by cheap I mean cheap. The body and screen are decent, however, the speaker quality is so dismal I am considering to selling it. 4a is at least a decent(ish) value for money and the camera punches above its weight. I initially got Pixel 5 but had to sell it because it had very much the same issues except it cost $650. The whole experience of 4a is very imbalanced. I miss the audio quality and materials of my Samsung Galaxy S7 every minute and that is a five year old phone. The drop in quality is shocking. If you use the phone as a phone, something designers at Goggle probably don't, you'll want to hurl it through the window soon. It is practically unusable as a speaker phone which is something the competition does usually very well. The loudspeaker accentuates any minor issues participants may have with their lines: the one that is a tad too bassy buzzes and sounds hollow, faint lines sound fainter etc. Samsung figured this out years back! Similarly, you will almost never be able to set the loudness level correctly between ringtones, alarms, media volumes between loudspeaker use and headphone use. Imagine you set your ringtone so that you can hear it in normal use. Then you switch to headphones to play a song. Then someone calls you. Your eardrums will almost explode because the phone is too dumb to adjust for headphones! Perhaps I am too focussed on the audio quality. But for me it is a key function. There is a lot of hype about Google products but substance is simply not there. Google sells you cheap iron designed by a team who really do not know how to make it work together. And a good camera. However, the competition caught up with the latter as well. I am still considering selling this phone too. Not happy.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Went from a pixel 2xl to a 3a to now the 4a. Pixels are clean no gimmick phones. The A series has everything you need and nothing you don't at a great price. I am a heavy user so I wish the battery was a bit bigger but that's my only complaint. I use it heavily for 10 to 11 hours a day and it still makes it through though. Would like it to last longer but I know I'm asking for a lot. This phone will be perfect if it came with a 4000 mah battery.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was a little weary about buying an unlocked phone on Amazon, but I ordered directly from the Google Amazon store and have had no issues. The phone came earlier than expected, and was brand spanking new as advertised. I easily activated it on my Sprint account online and transferred over everything from my old phone using the cable and adapter that was included. Battery life is long lasting, charges fast, amazing camera, and no issues with fingerprint scanner. Can't beat the price compared to comparable phones. Zero complaints thus far. Buy it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I got this phone after replacing my S9+ and although the specs are not as high as my old phone, this phone runs smoother because of the stock android. The battery is crazy good, it lasted me all day whereas the s9+ would last me all day but it would be less than 50%.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I used this phone for 2 weeks with a lot of pleasure. It is fast, makes beautiful pictures and lasted me all day. However, I went running with the phone in my hand and a bit of sweat got on it. The next day the whole screen was blue and black. So a good buy for the price, but be very careful with water.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Frustrating to set up a phone with all your info and then realize it's a verizon phone. The phone itself was great for a weekend. Love Google,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Cannot get this phone to connect to a PC or Chromebook. I also cannt get Google to erase my old phone and see only my new Pixel 4. It will connect to a laptop with the cable it came with but only to charge. It does not have an SD card either. I would appreciate anyone who can tell me how to transfer files via cable from my Pixel to my Acer Chromebook.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Pre ordered from Amazon direct and the screen color was off and the phone screen broke finally one time I dropped it. Bought my replacement from Best Buy locally (same exact model) and have dropped it a few times and screen color seems better on this one Beware buying from Amazon? Or maybe just avoid pre-ordering from the first batch?,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone for the money 3 years of Google updates,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Upgraded from an S6 I got when that model was just released. Better performance-wise on every level. Very fast phone and I love the battery system. It holds a charge significantly better than the S6. No reason why you can't go a full day with a full charge even if you're watching videos all day. It also learns your habits and lets you know in advance if you should charge your phone. Another cool feature is it allows you to watch videos on Youtube while using other apps even if you don't have a premium subscription. Very happy with my purchase.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Just got the pixel 4a on Friday release day when all the Amazon units started arriving, 3 days ago and loved it. Battery life seemed great and the phone was snappy. But after the 2nd day I noticed the 4a would not stop rebooting and I could not figure it out as I was not running any new apps. After scratching my head and playing around with it, it seems to be a physical build quality issue where the battery power source is interrupted. See the video of me tapping the phone on my desk and it just turning off, repeatable every time. After I filmed this video the phone would not turn back on. I posted this issue to Reddit and someone else confirmed they had the exact same issue. There must be some major quality control issue.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I switched from the old iPhone SE to this phone. I never needed the bells and whistles of the high end phones but I have always resented not having a good camera. The camera on this is great, it is better than the one on the newer iPhone SE. I don't need newer ""high end"" 2 or 3 lens camera systems of the higher end phones. It's overkill for me. I just wanted to be able to take basic photos including low light and it does this very well. Three years of updates sealed the deal. I will never willingly pay 1K for a ""high end"" phone. 349 is about the most I would ever pay, otherwise I would buy one used.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Got a Tello MVNO (Sprint) for only $12/month for emergency. When out and about, I can use wifi for internet and make phone calls, so I don't need data and calls.

I previously owned a OnePlus 5 for 3 years before deciding to buy a 4a. It's a great phone but it's fragile. I never cracked the screen on my OnePlus but a simple drop (with a case and screen protector on) cracked the screen on this phone. I wouldn't buy it again.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I had a Pixel 2XL, and it was working fine, but no longer supported with updates from Google. I bought this one, everything transferred over to this new phone seamlessly. I was concerned about the battery life after reading reviews, but I have no issues with it lasting throughout the day. It charges quite fast. I like the size better than the 2XL as it fits my hand better and is much more comfortable to hold. I also loved the price.

"If you want to buy an US Android smartphone that has minimal out-of-the-box bloatware, a headphone jack, fingerprint sensor, great camera, and an unlockable bootloader, there is only one phone on the market that meets that criteria, the Pixel 4a. I personally desire these features on my smartphone, but manufacturers have been removing them from their flagship smartphones from sometime. I used to only buy smartphone flagships and was always excited to upgrade. I purchased the first Google Pixel XL on launch day back in 2016 and it has been the best phone I’ve ever used. I loved my Pixel XL so much I have tried to replace it twice but ended up selling the newer phones as I considered them to be inferior. My Pixel XL stopped receiving software updates from Google a while back, but I’ve been able to extend its lifespan by loading LineageOS on it. Subsequent Pixel flagships have removed several features I want on my phone or added features I did not want. The Pixel 2 series removed the headphone jack, the Pixel 3XL had an ugly notch mimicking the iPhone X, and the Pixel 4 (non-A) series does not have fingerprint sensors. It really does not make sense that the Pixel 4a, a budget offering, has more features than the Pixel 4, but this is the reality we live in. I’d like to quickly run over the things I love about this device before I start tearing into with criticism. I love that it has a headphone jack. I have no problem with wireless technology, but Bluetooth in 2020 still provides inferior sound quality when compared to a wired connection. When I’m in my car or listening to headphones, I want a wired connection for the best quality possible. Wired headphones also don’t require batteries meaning they are much more environmentally friendly and never require battery replacement. I also love that this phone has an unlockable bootloader. If you want to keep this phone past the 3 year window of software support Google offers, you can load an aftermarket ROM on your device like LineageOS. It’s also a plus if you want to root your device. Many smartphone manufacturers (Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, Motorola, to name a few) either don’t allow this or limit the functionality to certain models which I consider unacceptable. Can you imagine if you bought a computer with Windows 7 but were forbidden from loading Windows 8 or Ubuntu on it? You don’t have to imagine, that’s essentially what most smartphone manufacturers do. Google doesn’t and I appreciate that. While an unlockable bootloader is nice, I would say that most people would like to use their new phones with out-of-box software as long as possible. Google’s version of Android is the closest thing to pure/bloatware-free that you can get. There are no duplicate apps (except YouTube/YouTube Music), and almost everything can be uninstalled or disabled out of the box. Mine did come with a T-Mobile app which I saw as strange since it’s an unlocked phone, but I was able to uninstall it. This is what I like to see. Other brands such as Samsung have gone as far as to create entire duplicate app stores, calendars, mail apps, assistants, and internet browsers that are not removable from their phones. Others, like OnePlus, now put Facebook services on phones out of the box. I am glad that Google has not embraced these practices and still leaves app choice up to the owner of the phone. The camera, like on all Pixel phones, is fantastic. Great low-light performance and amazing detail, contrast, and color. No other smartphone on the market can compare with the Pixel series of phones when it comes to cameras. Both the front and rear shooters take great shots, but for reasons I’ll get to later, I hate the front camera. So what are the compromises? This thing is cheap, gross, fingerprint-attractive plastic. In all honesty, I hate all plastic. Plastic is what disposable products are made from. I don’t want a plastic phone. Make it out of aluminum, steel, glass, whatever. But plastic is not acceptable on any smartphone in 2020, even a budget one. Immediately when I took this phone out of the box I hated how it felt in my hand. It feels like a kid’s tox, reminiscent of the iPhone 5c. You may think this is being harsh on a $350 phone but the iPhone SE 2 is made from aluminum and is the same price. The aesthetic design of the phone isn't too bad, if it were made of aluminum it would be a nice looking phone, that is, if it weren't for what I'll get into next. The screen is horrible. It’s only 1080p-equivalent (my Pixel XL from 2016 is 1440p, it’s not wide enough for my taste, and rather than have a bezel on the top of the phone like on the Pixel 4, Google instead decided to embrace the hole punch-style front camera design popularized by Samsung. Whenever you look at this phone, you are going to see this camera. It sticks out like a sore thumb, a giant black mark on the screen. It’s even worse when you’re watching videos in portrait mode, as the top of the display darkens to simulate an artificial bezel. If the video you’re watching is dark then rather than seeing the beautiful perfect black scenes you can achieve with an OLED screen, you see the camera. It’s also a distraction when you’re viewing a wide photo or video in landscape mode, it’s a giant black dot on the side like a fly landed on the screen. I spend a lot of time watching videos on my phone and this is not acceptable. When in dim rooms the camera hole is also very reflective and will shine light right into your eyes, adding further distraction. The only thing I can compliment is that at least the hole is off to the side and not in the center. It’s still terrible. I’m not happy with the fingerprint sensor. It’s plastic so it feels terrible, but it also doesn’t seem to read fingerprints well. To its credit it does read quickly, much more quickly than my Pixel XL, but I find myself having to read my print three or four times just to get it to unlock. I prefer optical under-screen fingerprint sensors such as those found on the OnePlus series of phones but can accept a rear fingerprint sensor if it’s accurate and quick. The sensor on the 4a does not seem to be accurate. The battery is too small at 3140mah. There are budget Indian and Chinese phones that are packing 4000mah+ batteries into smartphones of similar size, Google is lagging behind the competition. They’ve advertised this as having “adaptive” battery optimization and while it seems to perform fairly well out of the box, how well will it perform after several major updates and a few hundred charge cycles? One of my last jobs was spent working with batteries and one of the things I learned is that when it comes to lithium-ion cells, higher capacity + lower discharge depth = longer lifespan. Even if this phone can get you through morning to night with 10-15% capacity left of a 3,140mah battery, you’ll be left with a battery lasts less long than if you had a 4000mah battery ending the day at 30% before going back on the charger. Lithium-ion cells also degrade as they’re cycled. After 100 cycles a Lithium battery can lose as much as 5%-10% of its capacity. If you start with a larger cell then that degradation will be less of an issue as age sets in. Needless to say, Google fumbled on battery size. I think this is the best new Android phone on the market, but in the same breath, I think that reflects poorly on the Android smartphone market. You might think my criticisms are harsh considering the low price of the phone, but I did not buy this phone because it was cheap. I bought it because it has the features I want. If I had the option of buying a flagship smartphone with a headphone jack, fingerprint sensor, metal/glass body, excellent camera, large battery, no hole punch, and no bloatware, I would buy that. I can’t buy a new flagship smartphone like that so this is the next closest thing. I’m not even asking for luxury features like wireless charging. Basically, I feel no guilt in being critical towards the device’s flaws because my desires as a consumer are not being met by the companies I’m purchasing from. I would recommend this device if you need the features it has.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It's speedy, great camera, lightweight but sturdy, the screen isn't a fingerprint magnet, storage is good, no Bloatware, timely updates. About the only two things, I don't like and it really isn't the phone it's the OS is the app drawer needs auto-classification of apps, and the removal of the audible prompt when using the Google assistant except for when you're connected to a Bluetooth device such as your car system.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"All the smartphone one by one are transforming into a tablet, which are getting bigger, heavier, and uglier. I am so happy Google has decided to have its smartphone light, compact and mighty, plus they are all have great photo taking. It's highly commendable!!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pixel 4a was the home run Google needed , the software master that pixel devices always are , amazing camera , battery life and performance for it's price , the 730g on paper may seem pretty slow , but in real world use Ive found the performance only to slow down a few times in some heavy games , but overall it plays games quiet well , the lack of wireless charging and waterproof isn't a big deal to me but would have been nice . Google killed it with this phone and it's well worth the hard earned money.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is tiny, the screen is tiny... If your phone gamer this is likely not the one for you. It is much smaller than even the pixel 2. Perhaps this part of why it is only 350 rather than 6 something.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone with cheap price,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone was purchased after extensive research and positive first hand experience with the Pixel 3a. After several weeks of waiting for the new phone to ship after it was released, I am very pleased with the functionality of this new Pixel 4a. One of the biggest selling points for this phone is the price. I didn’t want to finance another $800 phone from Verizon so I opted for an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network. This phone was a bargain at $349, but there is nothing cheap about this phone except for the price. The Good: Besides winning on price, this phone was a breeze to set up. The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue. The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly. The Pixel 4a also transferred all data, apps, and pictures from my old Galaxy S7. It used a USB cable to connect and download everything. Even texts, voicemails, and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost. Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over. Apps needed to be logged into again and there were some forgotten password issues, but nothing that couldn't be fixed. Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate. It is a bit different than th 3a and other Android phone as there is no back button and everything is controlled through swipes. It takes some getting used to but works smoothly once you get it down. The camera is outstanding and surpasses any phone previously used. Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features. This battery lasts all day long even with regular use. The battery on the 3a is great and the battery on the 4a is awesome! It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge takes approximately one hour. The Bad: The bad really isn’t all that bad when taken in proper context. There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since it’s missing some luxury features. Apparently this phone isn’t waterproof, which comes as a surprise to me since I’ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water. Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing. It really isn't a big deal though since the battery lasts so long this phone is rarely on the charger anyway. This phone does take a USC-C cable so it isn't compatible with the cables from older Android and Kindle devices, which use Micro USB cables. It comes with one USB-C cable but you may want to purchase another if you like extra ones around the house or in the car. Again, not a huge deal because of the battery life. Summary: This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users. It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is, making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones. It wins in value, setup, camera, operating speed and battery life. Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have, but those don’t weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 4a so I am giving this a strong four stars.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I purchased this for a friend who didn't want to spend a bunch of money on a cellphone, but also wanted a nice camera. They've had this phone for a while now and the pictures they send me are really good! If you don't need a flagship phone, but you still want a ridiculously nice camera, then get this phone!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Bought through Verizon service provider. Very happy with the quality and value so far. I previously owned a Pixel and Pixel3.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
A couple reviews cited how cheap and plastic the phone felt or how the fingerprint scanner didn't work. I can say it feels just fine to me and the fingerprint scanner has worked everytime. I think you need to adjust your expectations when buying a $349 phone. Same thing with the lag on viewing of photos...that wasn't an issue for me. My only complaint so far is the battery life isn't as great as I expected. Still far an away better than my old phone. modified after using the phone for one week: the battery life is really bad. I docked it a star for that. I don't really use it that much and still it's dead by the end of the day. I'm testing out the extreme battery saver mode but that solution seems a bit....extreme.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've had this phone for a couple months now and absolutely love it! There's only one MAJOR problem and it's been happening since the phone was first purchased. That detail leads me to believe it's a manufacturing defects. As soon as I dial a number, the screen turns black and won't turn back on, no matter what I do. I can't use the side button to power it down because I can't use the screen and I can't end phone calls, etc. I have to wait for to other party to answer and hang up, or let the voicemail timeout and hangup on me. It's frustrating, especially when dealing with automatic robo-operators..",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Purchased 2 Pixel 4a phones a couple of weeks ago after owning HTC One for 6 years. Pixel is half the weight, smaller overall footprint but more screen real estate. Had to return one phone due to getting shocked while holding and erratic volume. Replacement was fine. Google, as usual, believes it owns all personal data generated from using phone. Constant pop ups, reminders, etc. until I figured out how to turn everything off possible. Menus 2-4 deep, nothing like Android on HTC. After 3 long days finally figured things out. Even the phone app was confusing. Aggregation will soon be fading memory. Very happy with usability now. Great camera. OK battery life as don’t download videos or other battery intensive applications. Fast recharge. Highly recommend. Used Pixel 4a for 3 weeks now. Google software is very buggy. Programs disappear on reboot, settings frequently change on own (mostly Google trying to steal personal information), new programs appearing I never even looked at, nagware, to name a few. The phone app is barely usable. The Contacts has a mind of its own with new names appearing and old ones disappearing. It is worthless. Texting app is not much better than phone software. Sorry I bought this phone. Had 3 other android phones without all the headaches. Battery life barely allows one to get through day, although fast charge is awesome.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone didn't last a year. It started jumping all over when I opened. I don't know the proper terms for this so I'll describe it. A green block appears around the object that it's on. To hit that key, for it to register I had to hit it so many times my finger hurt. Then I had to hit another key. I couldn't get to settings our factory reset. I have no idea what this is. But I know it doesn't work.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"After less than a year of use the device got stuck in a boot loop, and had to get it replaced. Researched the problem and it seems pretty common.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I love this phone. It's small but huge screen and feels perfect.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Good quality build and functions for a mid-range phone. The Pixel 4a is a little smaller overall than the 3a. The screen is about the same, but it extends to the full edge of the phone to achieve a similar screen size. But to do this, the corners of the screen are completely rounded, which I don't prefer as much, and the front camera lens is inside the screen, which hasn't been that big of a deal. The only problem so far is once the phone froze during an incoming call and couldn't be answered, phone had to be restarted. Battery life seems ok, but have to purposefully limit was the phone automatically accesses to limit use and extend battery.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Love it it order shy it's one of the best phones I have had,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought a new phone, but it has scratches.👎",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've been using this phone for just over two weeks now and I have absolutely no issues with it. This is the second Pixel phone I have had and I highly recommend it. So far it has been perfect for my needs. Good quality camera, battery life is decent, and the overall build feels sturdy and solid. The front camera was my only concern, but you get used to it taking up just a small portion of the screen. For $350, I cannot recommend this phone enough.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've used Pixel 3a for about a year and love that phone, now my wife needed new one and I got her this Pixel 4a instead of her old Samsung. She loves this phone as well. Great screen, amazing camera, very easy to use and full of features. The only complaint is no memory card slot for music or photos (not everyone has unlimited data plan). I would say Pixels like this one are the best phones you can get in this price range. People who complain about things like plastic body and other minor things perhaps need to realize they buy $350 unlocked phone, not $900 phone. You don't buy brand new car for 18 grands and complain that it doesn't have leather seats and all wheel drive, right?",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Pixel 4a is very nice phone. Budget friendly and camera is awesome compared to any other phone. Night sight camera is a plus. Worth buying. Fast and easy to use.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Review Result: [Buy Today, Get it Someday, or Skip Past Any day] Buy today, this is a very solid and high-quality cell phone to meet your everyday needs… for now. It has a great camera, good battery life, and a nice-looking screen. The camera in particular gets much more clear photos faster than all my previous phones. The fingerprint reader works like a charm. I don’t like face recognition, so I don’t use it. I do like the swipe gesture navigation too. My old phone must have had an older android OS version, so it was missing this. The main downside is no support for 5G. Many cities had 5G before now, some in 2019. It’s strange a phone that came out just a couple of months ago, August 2020, doesn’t have 5G capability. That’s why I note it “meet’s your everyday needs… for now.” In a couple years, anyone who can is better off getting a better phone that does have 5G support. Another minor annoyance is this “at a glance” widget. It shows up at the top of the home screen and it can not be removed… The only option is a new app launcher. Someone noted to use Nova in one message board. That’s what I use, and I changed the settings so it is the default. Now, my home screen is blank and free for me to add only the items I want. I shouldn’t have needed to add a new app launcher. Overall though, I like and recommend this phone to anyone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
After updating to Android 11 the devices is practically unusable. Scrolling would trigger links and toggles. Was very satisfied with the phone until the update came,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Everything about all the Pixels is great. 4a is simple to use. Has most all of the features (not all). Perfect size and fantastic price.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I am in love with the camera on this phone. It takes amazing photos. The amount of space on the phone is great and I really love that it screens calls for me. This is a fantastic feature for me because it answers the calls and send a transcription of what is said to me. The battery on this phone is crazy. It even can handle PokemonGo.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I bought it for my father. He is not good at using the smartphone. But he is excited on this. Battery is good. Camera is not the best. Cheapest and powerful in its class.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm very satisfied to own this new awesome phone, Google Pixel 4a. Also, it is full Android and no bloatware. Moreover, I have no issue to use LTE while I am in Honduras. It is very handy for my needed because I usually check the news, social medias, and useful accessibility for deaf like myself. I don't really care much about High Quality Camera and I am not a heavy gamer to play on the mobile; therefore, I don't use them much at all. Overall is Amazing!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Google pixel 4a -small, light and comfortable! I love this phone. Battery life is sufficient for all day with no charging. The screen is smaller than my last few phones but it is still super easy to type on and navigate! The camera quality is splendid and has tons of features. It is quick and accurate to go from app to app with no lagging, and is super quick for the fingerprint scanner to recognize my print. I really have no complaints with the phone at all and see it holding up for awhile in the future!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Stopped working after 4 weeks. I tried to return it and it was 3 days over the limit. Google wanted $250 to repair a phone purchased for $350 4 weeks before. Would never buy a google phone again.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Performed outstanding and could not ask for more at twice the price - it's a real Bargin!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Maybe it's just me but the fingerprint reader only reads my left index finger and not my right. I'm only 20 so I don't think my prints would be worn off from years of working. The battery is fantastic however and there's more storage on this phone than ANYbody needs. It's definitely worth the money.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"All around its a solid phone, but it has a huge flaw. It overheats too fast. I used the video call and within 18 mins to 25 minutes it got hot. It even turned off on me I thought maybe the battery has died, but once i restarted the phone it told me the phone had overheated thats why it turned off. I also had a lot of audio call issues with multiple people. I return it ,but if the heating issue wasnt there I would have kept it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Small. Simple. Effective. Beautiful Camera. Works Great. Couldn't ask for a better cost effective smart phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I used to be a samsung guy but after seeing my coworker use this phone I looked at the price and was blown away. This phone is the best bang for your buck that you will ever get out of a phone. The camera is amazing.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought this phone late February. I’ve barely exposed it to any water (aka when it rains). Today, I went on a bike ride and it was exposed to minimum sweat and now the phone is screen is turning black and blue. I put the phone in rice and it’s getting worse. This is not worth buying. Don’t waste your money.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone seems responsive enough. Things I don't like: no SD card, short battery life, usb cable won't plug into others chargers, etc",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"For the price, it comes with a lot of features. The battery life is definitely my favorite as it easily lasts me from 6am-8am before I need to think about plugging it in.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This was a great phone. Full stop, great phone. However, after the recent Android 11 update, the phone is UNUSABLE with a screen protector. The touchscreen is now too sensitive, registering taps when you're scrolling and not letting you smoothly use the phone... For anything. This is NOT an isolated issue either. There are hundreds of reports of the same issue on Google's support site. The worst thing is Google knows about this issue with Android 11 but hasn't done anything to fix it for weeks. So if you plan on getting this phone and using it with a screen protector, DON'T EXPECT IT TO WORK. Pixel 4a + Android 11 + screen protector = garbage.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It's a good price and phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Highly recommended. Easy to use, great battery life, great camera, up-to-date and clean version of Android without the usual manufacturer bloatware. One downside is that it doesn't have an SD card slot, but I'm finding the 128gb builtin storage is more than enough for now. I bought this as a replacement for a Motorola Moto Z2 Play phone after the front glass started to separate from the frame. The Motorola was a little bigger than the Pixel 4a (and a little unwieldy if the truth be told) but to my mind the smaller size of the Pixel 4a makes it easy to handle, certainly one-handed. Though smaller in overall size the whole-screen display of the Pixel 4a seems to be about the same size as that of the Motorola and I find it runs a bit faster than the Motorola too. Overall very pleased with the new phone .",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is amazing. As someone who was in need of an upgrade on the android side of cell phones, I went with this phone simply because of the various positive reviews a saw of it on YouTube. I for one wanted a good camera on my phone and this device meets my need. Although video can be better, it is still usable. The still photos are awesome, no complaints there! It's an easy to use phone with good battery life and smooth performance. In my opinion, you are getting more for what you pay for. (Ignore any reviews below 4 stars, they are either paid to give a bad review, switched from a more pricey phone, or had a defective device)",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S5 mini. This 4a is much snappier and Android 11 has evolved quite a bit since the Samsung's V5. The GPS works MUCH better than the S5 and the fingerprint reader on the backside works really well.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"very pleased with phone,battery lasts a long time",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The battery life on this phone is really pretty amazing. That part is awesome. I have become used to bigger phones, however, so the small form factor (which is probably better for some people) is uncomfortable to me. The phone is also CRAZY light, which I'm not used to at all, and freaks me out every time I hold it because it feels so fragile. The camera is.. oddly... not particularly impressive. A selfie did do a decent job of a bokeh background but... it looked artificial, and nothing compared to a DSLR camera, or even the iPhone portrait mode. Very artificial, and probably not something I will use much. Fingerprint reader on the back is quite good. Nice location, functions well. Because of the small size, I might end up giving this to my 10yo, but if it was me, I would want the XL... but probably would prefer an iPhone, if I could afford one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"You get a high quality smartphone for a quarter of a price, of a flagship phone. No need to buy expensive phones, this is a total reaper. Great camera quality, all day battery, fast, responsive and versatile.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Got the pixel 4a, knowing the battery wasn't the best. Camera is excellent, as most reviewers mentioned. But I did not see the following, which would have made me think again about buying it: 1. NOT AS 'UNLOCKED' AS YOU THINK. Got the unlocked version, but am still locked into features that cannot be changed. Example: the default on-screen keyboard. Needing a Delete Key, which is not present on the Pixel 4a's default, I downloaded a thirdy party keyboard... only to learn YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE DEFAULT ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD, EVEN ON THE UNLOCKED VERSION. That alone would have made me go elsewhere, but it is now my 21st day owning this phone, which brings me to: 2. 15-DAY RETURN POLICY, NO MORE. If you're past the fifteen days of having purchased (or received, if you ordered it), you are S.O.L. You might counter 15 days is not bad, and in fact is quite typical, considering all that could be done with a phone in that period. But this is Google we're talking about, and when you see them accepting a non-optimal standard, it's probably because that standard makes them more money than they think could be brought onboard by challenging it. 3. RESTOCKING FEE. Even if you manage to return your phone within the 15 days, you'll have to pay for the shipping and a restocking fee. The payment of one is marginally acceptable, IMO, but when you see a company genuinely confident in their product, they'll cover both. By only covering one (or neither) Google is telling us they get a lot more of these consumer-rejected returns than expected.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Wonderful phone!! Very light and takes great pictures!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Liked the phone overall, main issue is with android stock and limited customization options mainly for the homescreen. I know i could change the launcher, but it would be better if google let some more options available",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It's a slow phone, some apps doesn't open as quick as even my Oneplus 6T, hence the missing star. I thought the pictures from the camera have too much dynamic range for my taste. BUT... I wanted a new phone that still have a dedicated fingerprint scanner because on screen scanner is still slow (based on 6T and Samsung S10). I want a phone that is light and small, with a good enough camera. I don't play games on my phone so I don't need no latest and greatest silicones. I don't worry about drops because it's polycarbonate, and I disliked glass backs ever since the LG V30. The Pixel 4a is simple, it's clean, it works, and it runs the latest Android. I would have wanted an even bigger battery because it would probably still be lighter than most phones. Plus it has a headphone jack. All in all this is a utilitarian phone, and it's a phone for me.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Volume control button on the side of the phone stopped working after 5 months of use. Terrible customer service and there are no Google Stores around for a warranty replacement. Google wants me to send the defective phone back before sending a replacement. So someone is supposed to be without a phone until then? Never again!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
So imagine buying a cheap android and putting an expensive camera on it. That's what this phone is. I usually get 100 dollar androids where the phone freezes and the battery life sucks and the phone is alowt. Well all of this stuff happens to this phone but the only pro is the camera is spectacular. It's literally one of the best cameras I have ever had. So if you want an ok phone with a great camera this is the phone for you,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Pros: Long Battery Life Cons: The screen turns off, and is unusable until after multiple attempts I reboot it. This phone is an absolute piece of crap. Some people say it's a problem with Android 11, or the screen saver (took it off). It is Still happening. BTW, this is a known problem, just search for Pixel 4a black screen or screen not working. Dude even made a YouTube video about it less than a week after it was released. I am so unhappy, I wish I had just kept my moto g5 plus- the only reason I got a new phone was because I was concerned about security without any updates.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Do not buy this phone! As soon as the return window closed all kinds of issues arose with this phone. It started with over heating, then came the screen flickering (strobe light like), then came shutting the screen off all together until phone is restarted, now I'd say 30% of my touch screen is completely unresponsive and best part about that is each day it's new areas of the screen, parts that worked fine yesterday no longer work today but don't worry they will work great tomorrow. I've tried resetting to factory settings and all the other self fixes I can try. Even tried getting a warranty claim started on multiple occasions but good luck doing that when you can't use half your touch screen.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone performs like a higher end phone and is pretty much everything you would want at a great price. But, there is one major drawback that you should consider - this thing is EXTREMELY flimsy. After only a few days of using it, only carrying it in my pocket, no drops, nothing, the casing on the phone is already creaking when applying light pressure. I have my doubts as to whether this thing would even last a year.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Phone for personal use. Absolutely not user friendly, compared to LG phone I had previously. This is a ""typical"" Google ""nerd"" phone that is designed for techies, not for ""normal"" older users. Camera is great I guess--use it about once every month--I have cameras. Battery and charging are excellent. Non-standard USB cord provided--need to buy others for car,etc. Big problem has been phone never rings, or when it does, it impossible to ""swipe"" to open. Bad notifications (none) Never know when messages or voice mail is received--have to manually check. Google continually send automatic notices and pop-ups to sell more products--can't turn off. When you turn off one function, it will normally turn OFF others, e.g., sound, so you never get notices of calls. Biggest advantage is that it is a smaller phone, 5+ by 2+ inches, easier to carry than the nerd 7"" X 3"" monsters. I bought it partly for blue-tooth connectivity, which is OK. My LG was 100% more user friendly.I had bought the Apple LS, but it died within a week, so I went back to Android--Big Mistake. Now have to eat $500 to change, LG does not make the small phone anymore. No one does it seems. My phone hone is used primarily for calls. Do not need an additional pre-installed 45 google apps on the phone that lacks basic functionality. Google does not understand user design=KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)!! P.S.

"Nice and compact phone I ever used..Night mode is very nice.Potrait mode takes some time to process but result will be fantastic.. After two days of usage, found battery seems to much enough for me as I am not a heavy gamer and I use mostly for camera and calls. Pixel is too smooth though it has 60hz..And device is bit slippery in hand and it is better to protect it with case. I need to take the mobile each time in my hand if I need to use fingerprint to unlock.. If it has face unlock it will be fast enough like my iphone11. Otherwise speed,camera everything equals to iphone11 Edited: After one week of usage, found battery seems to be much optimized and I am getting one day solid.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The quality of pictures this phone takes more than makes up for any issues it might have. It is not the fastest or biggest or fanciest, but did I mention that the pictures it takes are amazing!

excellent phone for the price !!! smooth and fast ..good camera and battery life !!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
very good,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I don't care for 5G so this was the best option for me. You get nearly all the same features as the 4a 5G and the 5, minus a few gimmicky camera tricks for recording videos. I think I'll live. The battery lasts all day with heavy use and the charger is fast. 0-100% in one hour. The google pixel experience is all here and for this price, that's a steal.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I pre-ordered this phone a month before it was released thinking it would be an amazing phone. And also my first Pixel device. The first con was it was ""released"" at the end of August, yet I didn't receive it until September 16th. So not off to a great start. I rarely say negative things about a smartphone but in this case, I feel like there aren't enough reviews outlining the issues I encountered with this phone. I'll start with the pros Great price Pretty good camera 128 gb of storage 6 gb of ram 3 years of updates Now onto the cons Dim screen. This one surprised me for this to be an OLED screen the brightness was very unimpressive. Especially outside. Battery life wasn't nearly as good as advertised. The photo of the screen on time I included was the best I ever got. Not even close to the 7-8 hours advertised or in most reviews. The size felt small despite being a 5.8 inch screen. To me this is a con because of my vision. Overall this device is good but in my opinion not great for the price. I ultimately sold it pretty quickly. I am a huge fan of Motorola which the setup of the Pixel is almost identical to. Except you pay noticeably more. I got a Moto g fast on cyber Monday for $105 which is a much better value for the price. I also was able to get a Samsung galaxy a51 right after I sold my Pixel which is much brighter with better battery life for $199. Point being my advice is look at all your options before buying this device. While it's a solid phone, mid range and even some lower end devices are getting really good. And offer as much if not more than phones like the Pixel 4a. The purpose for me doing this review is to potentially help anyone trying to decide whether to get this or not.

"I switched from a Samsung Galaxy and I couldn't be happier. The price, the durability, the size, and the available apps are all exactly what I wanted. I don't need a phone so big it's uncomfortable to carry in my pocket and I simply see no value in a 5G phone right now. Google hit it out of the park with this phone and at less than half the cost of a flagship phone, I'm amazed I don't see more people carrying a 4. The lack of wireless charging and the less than outstanding battery life is a drawback but that's the price you pay for not going flagship. I keep a charging cord at my desk and as long as you don't need to go without for more than a business day, there's really no problem.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Compared to Xiaomi of the same price range, redmi note 5 that has worked well for me over 2 years: Pros: Smaller (individual bias), the main reason I chose it besides the political correctness. Cons: - Low battery capacity, more than 2-yr lag - Poor UI. One may argue about the simplicity, but shy customizability is the issue: you cannot change from 5 apps a row to 4; can't change the color of the notification dot/bubble; can't skip the confirmation upon entering the PIN... Overall, it's an okay budget phone but it's a disappointment given Google's hyped brain power.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Got this phone last fall and it was bricked by one of Google's own android updates a couple months later. I'm still trying to get them to make good on the warranty by either fixing or replacing the phone and it's been one of the worst customer support experiences I've ever had up there with Sprint and Uber.

"$349 New Android phone,How can find another one better than pixel 4a",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I was worried about the phone being too big after holding on to my old 4.8 inch phone for dear life. The width isn't much bigger and it is slim so it fits with a pop socket for one handed texting. Set up was really easy and seamless going from my old iphone. Great picture quality. It has its own charger style (not Android or iPhone) so I plan to buy an extra cord for on the go. Battery life is insane and I love the fingerprint on the back. I haven't dived into facial recognition yet. I'm ecstatic at the phone for the price point. Also really excited to have a match for my Google home mini!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Upgraded from an S6 I got when that model was just released. Better performance-wise on every level. Very fast phone and I love the battery system. It holds a charge significantly better than the S6. No reason why you can't go a full day with a full charge even if you're watching videos all day. It also learns your habits and lets you know in advance if you should charge your phone. Another cool feature is it allows you to watch videos on Youtube while using other apps even if you don't have a premium subscription. Very happy with my purchase.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Their is currently a nasty bug in Android 11 that affects the Pixel 4a(Including myself). While using a screen protector, you will get phantom touches and unresponsive scrolling. Navigation gestures are unresponsive or erratic. Gesture style keyboards are nearly impossible to use. It really gets bad when the phone gets hot, which doesn't take long at all when you're using it. I've been pulling my hair out dealing with the issue. Hope a fix is coming. Been this way since Android 11 dropped. The Issue was not present in Android 10. Plus side. The camera on the phone is absolutely superb. This thing takes awesome clear crisp pictures. Fast charging and sleek body design. Doesn't feel cheaply made. Speakers are loud and the phone is perfectly sized. This will be a 5 star once Google fixes the sensitivity issue! Update: October security patch just came out and Google fixed the issue. Yaay. I cannot reproduce the touchscreen sensitivity issue.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Nice!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I gave this 3 stats because of the software. I felt like google could've done a better job especially since this is a pure android device. The notification system is stupid. When someone text me and I respond to it from the notification window the text remains there in the notifications. If I'm the last person to respond why do I need to see my own .message in the notifications?? That's stupid! If I respond the notification needs to go away! If get a bunch of notifications (emails, text) and I swipe them away, more notifications show up IMMEDIATELY. Sometimes they aren't even new. I literally have to press ""clear all"" 3x for the notifications to go away. I also don't like that if I'm on a website that I'm trying to upload a image to, the phone sends you on a wild goose chase to find your ""gallery"". By default it brings up ""recent images"" and I think that's dumb. You should be able to choose what it defaults to. Even still when you press on ""camera"" it'll still take you to another screen that you have to press ""camera"" again just to get to the images you took with your camera. These things can be fixed with software but it's super annoying, especiy the notifications. Not to mention I bought a fossil smart watch that runs wear OS and if I check a email from last year, the watch will send me a notification from that email like I just received it! STUPID! FIX THIS STUFF GOOGLE! Battery is ok considering this is a mid level phone. Kinda get what you pay for on that one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My main reason for purchasing this phone is storage and quality camera. I was not disappointed! Amazing quality camera with the option of multiple shots taken to choose the best one. Google creates automatic collages from pictures and will even bring back ""memories"" from years ago. Great storage space as well. Fingerprint reader was a bonus, although I've noticed it is not 100% all the time. Perhaps due to my cleaning and disinfecting of my phone with COVID season.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Great, great, experience thus far (after 4-5 days). I was on the line between this and the pixel 5 and man am I glad I went with this. All the features I need. To me there's no need for official waterproofing etc because it holds up just fine in rain etc. I'm not trying to throw my phone into a pool. But you know what? Even if I do and it doesn't survive, I can BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR $350!!! Buy this phone!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I would not purchase from this company again... These phones are marketed as new, but the first one I got had problems and the replacement the charging port went bad within 6 months. Go elsewhere for your Android phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The two great things about the pixel are it's price point and camera. Everything else including proper camera controls was forgotten. The main issue is the screen sensitivity, I have medium sized hands and fingers (size 9-10) and am quite adept at typing but I felt like I was losing my mind and motor skills trying not to fat finger this keyboard even at its tallest and least cluttered setting. I tried typing the same sentences on different devices and would have 4x the amount of errors on that keyboard. It does help to remove the glass screen protector but then you lose that layer of protection. Most of the new features and controls advertised are either novelties, poorly implemented, or downright dysfunctional. The gesture controls are chaotic. Basically making the entire edge of the screen a very sensitive swipe to go back which is more like the slightest touch will trigger it. Trying to scroll down through a long article... nope you triggered the back button and now you have to reload the page or app. Want to pass the phone to someone to show them a photo, nope either of you will likely trigger that back command and they'll wonder what you were trying to show them. So I switched back to the old 3 button layout but wait.. they put a button for Live Transcription right next to the Square ""Overview"" button so there have been many occasions that I unknowingly triggered it and drained my battery transcribing a walk through the woods or me muttering to myself while editing or programming. I use a lot of Google Home devices and it is getting annoying to have to avoid using the world Google like your saying Voldemort in some Rowling novel or else you get cursed with the Assistant trying to search for or make a music selection based off of a snippet of your completely unrelated conversation. Finally that lovely little camera has the worst most non-intuitive controls I have ever used on a phone. Sure you can get some great astrophotography shots but you have to turn on Night Sight mode and hope that the camera detects stars or something to trigger the mode. Yes you can't shoot astrophotography unless the phone thinks that is what you want. Try fighting phone controls in the late evening in 20 degree Yosemite park and you'll wish you had a DSLR with actual buttons so you can keep your gloves on, touch screen gloves are thin and don't work well due to aforementioned sensitivity issues. Switching between camera modes requires a swipe and then some have a popup so to go from Portrait mode to Slow-mo you have to carefully swipe over a couple icons and then touch one of the options that appears above video all with a very temperamental screen. It is not fun especially when your cat is being adorable and you miss shots. I also have a feeling this phone will be quickly unsupported by Google as they are already releasing things for the 5 and 5g models that aren't available for this one. Then it seems like they are randomly and silently removing features as well. For now I am going back to my old phone (a very unsupported, cracked, and dull LG G6) and now being both burnt out from the new Pixel / Android mobiles and the IOS options, I may just relieve myself of the burden of carrying a smart phone and go for a simpler approach.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I owned the first Android phone, the TMobile G1, and I've owned the Google Nexus phone, but I never owned a Pixel. Earlier phones left a lot to be desired, but not this one. I kind of wanted a Pixel phone but they were always a little outside my budget. After waiting awhile I finally decided to buy a Pixel 4a. Everything, the size, screen, performance (no lag), call and speaker quality, bluetooth and WiFi connectivity, 3.5 mm jack, battery life, and of course the camera are all outstanding. I'm extremely happy with this. I also bought the Crave case and OMOTON screen protectors. I look forward to a couple years of good service until I upgrade to the next version.

"First off, I just wanna say that this view is from the point of view of an AVERAGE BUYER. All the reviews by people who review phones for a living are not accurate for someone like me to decide if I want to purchase this phone. These people are way harsher than the average smartphone buyer! Some people say this is a “budget” phone, but this is the most expensive phone I’ve ever owned. A lot of thought went into buying it, and I’m so glad I did! Camera: WOW. Just wow! This camera has the cleanest and sharpest image I’ve ever seen in person on a smartphone. I’m attaching some of my favorite photos it’s taken. So much DETAIL!! I included some photos of my dog and cat because I absolutely LOVE the amount of detail. And one photo of people to see how the selfies look!! Battery life: this phone’s battery life is very impressive. I usually only charge my phone over night so it’s ready to go the next day. I have owned this phone for almost 4 months and I have yet to charge it more than once in a 48 hour span. And the charger that comes with it charges my phone SO FAST. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Size: I absolutely love how much smaller this phone is compared to the past 4 phones I owned! It’s still a decent size but it actually fits in my jeans pocket. The screen size makes up for it because it takes up literally the entire front of the phone. Overall: I know this review lacks a lot of key features for this phone and it definitely doesn’t do it justice. But overall this phone is amazing and I would buy it again. This is my first Google phone and I’m impressed! Go for it!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Amazing phone I was stuck on the same phone for 4 years and I wanted to get something thing new. And this phone does not disappoint. All the reviews are exactly what I imagined.

"My phone was dying so I selected a Google Pixel 4a to replace it. So far, there are things I really like and things I'm getting used to having to live with. The battery life is amazingly long. I do not have busy days and I do not use my phone all day. Battery life is approximately 4 days! The hardest thing to get used to is no back button. Learning how to navigate takes a little time. But, it's going well and is easy to learn. Happy with my choice, so far. It's been good enough that my husband also bought one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"An important smartphone release at a time when there seems to be a real shift away from flagship devices and a move toward mid range value propositions. And with the global economic challanges ahead, the release of the Pixel 4a could be a watershed moment. The form factor is ideal for me. Whilst I understand the benefits of larger screens, the tradeoffs are too big IMO. The 4a is just so easy to handle and carry and it is so light! The pure Android is a plus. I have had bloatware on my previous two devices (Huawei) so it is a welcome change. The option to 'pause' apps is great too. Battery is good. Easily a full day. I now have battery saver mode set to auto-enable at 75% and can get 1.5 days of moderate usage. I have not had a chance to use the camera much at all but can say that the colours are an improvement over my Huawei P30 and so is the video stabilization. The P30 has an excellent camera with some advantages over the 4a but I like the results from the 4a more. As an aside, the P30 was a form favourite of mine, the best smartphone I had owned. Ticked a lot of boxes including its compact for factor. It edges the 4a on performance (the 4a does suffer from occasional lags and stutters) and has a few extra features like face unlock and onscreen fingerprint reader. But the 4a has nudged in front of the P30, albeit only slightly. Anyway, I am sold on the 4a. It delivers in spades. I don't need wireless charging nor do I drop my phones in water. I don't need a 90+hz display (the 4a's OLED display is excellent BTW) nor do I need facial recognition. I like having the option of a headphone jack though and I like having extra money to spend on other things in life. I have purchased the Spigen Rugged Armour case which provides excellent protection.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Don't like how some of the google updates have changed things. Otherwise pretty good phone at fair price.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Back camera unusable after 3 months, incredible lag. None of the ""Fixes"" from google work. My two options under the warranty? Send in the phone and have no phone at all while it's being repaired (estimated at 2 weeks) or drive 150 miles to the nearest UbreakIfix store location. If I have someone local repair the phone out if pocket it will void my warranty. Google support fails on this one",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is my second Pixel phone, I bought this to replace my 3A just to get more memory, and gave the 3A to a friend. I think there is an advantage to buying the phone made by the same company that makes the operating system. You get updates first and everything in the Android system works perfectly for the most part. The camera is really quite amazing for a single lens camera. Extras like Google lens which lets you photograph anything and turn it into a web search is great. My only complaint is the voice to text function for texting is not very good. I had a low priced LG that worked far better in this area. I constantly have to go back and make corrections and replace misheard words. I have searched for a solution to this problem and have not found it. That is my only complaint. Otherwise I love the phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The time of the $1000 phones for bells and whistles may have ended in 2020. Hey, we needed SOMETHING to go right. I use a OnePlus 8 as my daily driver and was excited to try this Pixel 4a out. I knew that it had rave reviews for the camera and it absolutely blows my OnePlus 8 out of the water. Otherwise, the device runs smoothly for most tasks. I am used to the 90hz screen, so the 60hz is definitely noticeable on the Pixel 4a. However if you have never had a phone with 90hz or don't have a clue what I am talking about, you won't notice a thing with the Pixel 4a. :) Other great features include the size. Yes, I have a 6"" plus phone and I absolutely LOVE this smaller sized Pixel. So easy to carry and to use. I also love the fingerprint reader. It works super well and is accurate probably 95% of the time...even more possibly. What's not to like? I am not a big fan of the plastic feel, but that is to be expected with a device at this price point. I am also not big on the real life battery life. It was great for the first week of just using as a camera, but it started to even out with my OnePlus, but with much less usage than the other. It does have relatively fast charging though, so there's that. All in all, for the money you're not going to find a much better device yet. There are things coming that may meet or exceed this, but for the moment I am a strong believer in the Pixel 4a.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It's quick and I like the feel in my hand. I am still struggling a bit with closing apps and pages. Sweeping up or down, left or right, I don't see which way is right. The alarm app doesn't allow me to choose one day in the coming week. It is either today/tomorrow or forever repeat of a different day.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I got this great deal from Amazon for the Pixel 4a - it was arrived very fast. The phone works as expected and no issue with the transition from Pixel 3 XL.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone itself is absolutely amazing, performance is great, even though some reviewers are saying that it is falling behind some other competitors, I haven't really noticed any hiccups or lags while using the phone and apps almost always stay open in the background unless I open like 20 of them. I don't really play games on my phone but I think it will handle most games with ease unless u want to play on max settings. Screen is really really good, I came from a samsung so I know what a good amoled screen feels like and this one is great, even at this resolution the image and the color accuracy is really sharp, could have been a little brighter though, but haven't really bothered me its good enough even in the sunlight. Camera is absolutely amazing, especially at this price point, its flagship class. Night mode is absolutely amazing. Takes amazing pictures, sharp and color accurate. Video recording is great as well. The only downside can be considered the fact that sometimes when you take a pictures it takes like 2-3 second to process it, but other than that it is really really good, like one of the best. Many people say that the holepunch camera cutout is annoying, but it is in a such a spot that it disappears in use, even during watching videos and movies. I almost never notice it while watching content or browsing, unless I absolutely have to see an info that is written on that corner. Battery, the probably the only downside of this phone, you might be like why? well because it is inconsistent, it can last you with the same exact use on most days for like 6 and even 7 hours! but on others it might last 3 or 4, I don't understand why is the battery like this, from what I have researched in background it runs some kind of android system process that bottlenecks it from time to time. But overall I would rate it 4 stars, would have been 5 if it was not like this. Fingerprint scanned is, well really really fast, almost instant, but like other fingerprint scanners, if your fingers are wet it wont recognize them, but its like this on like 90% of others phones which I have used with this feature so It doesn't really bother me. Build quality is good, I don't mind the plastic back because it feels really good in your hand, its smooth and not slippery, it is really nice to hold it in hand, but as most other users I have a case on it. Other google features really make this phone a good experience, for example the music recognition and others. Overall this phone is a solid 4.7 out of 5, as I said the battery can be a mix bag but other than that it is great. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants a good phone, which has some good features, amazing camera, good battery life on most days, nice screen, good performance and solid, nice feel in the hand. Especially at 350$ dollars it is a steal.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

The camera far exceeds my expectations and is considered an extra feature for me. Included apps have safety features that aren’t present in any other phone. It’s such a magnificent device. The only gripe I have with this phone is it ships with Android 11, meaning NO OVERSCAN API!! Disgusting. Now I have to live with a big thick navigation bar. Other than that, everything else is fine. Will update in a few months if anything major happens with my new phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"With this phone, the hardware and the software are allowed to integrate into their perfect potential. Google being the creator of both is likely what makes this phone better than its (overpriced) competitors. I haven't had the phone for quite a month yet, so I'll update this review if I need to. Here's where a more ""budget"" phone surprisingly stands out: 1) The speaker has more clarity versus that of the Note10+. 2) The fingerprint reader on the back has a much higher success rate than the Note10+'s (in regards to accuracy). It is also easier to physically use. 3) Google kindly allows for the bootloader to be unlocked. So if you are feeling bold, you can load on a custom ROM. (Who knows? Maybe that would help you learn to love coding; it did for me.) 4) Insane battery life. I charge it every other night. And this isn't with light use; I'd say the same might be true for you. 5) The ergonomics of the phone make it easy on the hand to hold. It rarely falls out of my hand, unlike the Note10+. It really should get a star off for not being water-resistant, and another half-star off for not supporting wireless charging. But it's just such a well-performing machine that I refuse to subtract anything from my rating. TL;DR - This is the closest Android you can get to what makes an iPhone so special, which is the hardware and software being tightly integrated from the factory.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Today (Dec. 29, 2020), the volume button stopped working again. I hope it will come back and start working again. This has happened a couple times so far, each time, before I called, the volume button started working again. voice command could also be easily triggered on this Pixel phone, and this annoy/unwanted feature definitely can drive people nuts. There is NO USB-C Cable with this phone order, and I did not have one at home. I called seller's support line, but was told google store sell this USB-C cable for about $20. This was NOT convenient & NOT nice! A C-to-C cable was included, however, with C on both end, I could not plug it to my portable charger nor laptop.

"My little family has used phones from Apple and Samsung for many years. This phone from Google is in the same price range as iPhone SE-2020 and I can compare the two. This phone from Google is larger than the iPhone. The iPhone has wireless charging, this phone does not. The look and feel of the iPhone is slick and glassy, the Google phone is slightly plasticky. Both phones feature a stupid, sticking-out camera structure on the back. The Google phone offers a bit more protection to the camera lenses than the iPhone. The Apple phone features software that is much less of a privacy/security problem than the Google phone. This is true for the Android operating system, which is designed to spy on you. It is also true of the Google app store, which is a cesspool of creepy software. This phone from Google replaces an ancient iPhone that our teenager is using. Her transition from iPhone to Android went smoothly. She reports that ""The interface is easy to use and very elegant. The functions are all well organized and easy to find on the screen as well. The camera captures clear and beautiful pictures."" With Android phones such as this, getting big software updates can be a problem. Your phone carrier might prevent it, and the phone maker may also prevent it. Choosing an Android phone from Google itself might prove to be an advantage. With a Google phone, you also lose a layer of low quality software from the phone carrier and the phone maker. Honestly, I really dislike Android but this phone is a very nice piece of work. It is a solid value as well.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Good camera, battery doesn't last long.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Love the phone jack - HATE the battery. Missing features like the side squeeze to activate the assistant. It's just ""Meh"" in the Google pixel line up.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone, but the vibration settings are poor at best. I can only see one setting and it is next to non-existent. I would not have purchased if I had known. But if you don't need that feature, great phone. Not sure who does not need the vibration function.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The cameras on this phone are absolute trash compared to my pixel 3. Otherwise the exact same phone, not worth the upgrade.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have updated from a Samsung 850A from 5 years ago. Obviously i am not a power user, but i text all the time, use Google everyday, and run some apps regularly like Sirius, Amazon, Strava and Instagram. After 4 weeks of use, i am averaging 3 days on battery life. I have good cellular and 4G signal where i live, so that may help. Probably why my old phone lasted over 5 years with just 1 battery replacement. I love not having extra Samsung or AT&T software. Find myself using new apps and the internet more on the phone because it is very fast. This phone is great for my usage style.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've been an iphone user forever. I always get the newest iphone every year, but have dabbled in android phones a handful of times, the last being the exploding Note phone by Samsung. Lately I've felt utterly bored by iOS and apple in general. Every iteration feels like the same thing over and over for more and more money. I started questioning whether I truly needed a $1,000 cell phone, especially a brand new one every year. I feel that flagship phones are at a point of diminishing returns. I don't game on my cell phones much, and there's nothing I'm doing that needs $1k worth of hardware to accomplish. Youtube, texting, internet browsing, occasional Twitter use makes up the majority of my consumption. I started browsing what current android phones are offering once I made the decision that I was going to leave Apple and ios behind. First I looked at Samsung, but quickly realized that they are essentially the Android version of Apple, very expensive and flashy, but not offering simplicity. After some more browsing of Sony, motorola, oneplus etc, I came upon the Google Pixel line. Pixels are not flashy, they don't fold in half, they don't have super ultra extreme warp charging. What they offer is a simply attractive phone, with unalulterated, bloatware-free Android OS, monthly security updates, day one major android updates, regular ""feature drops"" and, for the Pixel 4a anyway, awesome battery life. The 4a is a no-frills, budget phone that punches way above it's price tag, and performs unlike what I thought a ""budget"" phone would feel like. I very much enjoy having a fingerprint reader again, and the headphone jack is a pleasant addition, though I don't use it much it's nice to know it's there if I need it. 5g isn't and won't be available in my rural new england area likely for years, so it's nice to not pay extra for a feature I'll never miss. Simply put, this is THE phone to get if you want an inexpensive but strong-performing experience. For $350, this phone cannot be beat.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Very good phone overall, great camera with many settings.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I was on an Iphone that I didn't want to get in the first place but was bullied into. This phone is everything i could ask for and works amazing.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My Pixel 3a charging cables don't work on Pixel 4a... So I need all new accessories? Fingerprint scanner is an improvement over 3a. SMS texts stopped coming in for two days because Google broke them. Play store glitches while trying to download the apps, so why can't Google allow straight up APK transfers instead of forcing you to re-download everything on weak signal? Google is just going downhill. A lot of the apps are glitchy and slow on pixel 4a. It's not a noticeable improvement over the pixel 3a, although I have not tried the camera yet. Heck to all the engineers designing things that need internet connections... No good offline modes anymore... I can't even play GTA v on my PC offline without it wanting to authentication key online. Hate!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Was very excited about this phone. Am big fan of Google products. Have both the Pixel 1 and Pixel C tablet. But when I got the Pixel 4a phone I noticed it keeps randomly restarting when plugged into my2.4A usb car charger. This charger and the cable I used were previously used frequently with my Pixel 1 and worked fine. Google sent me a replacement Pixel 4a but it did exactly the same thing.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I really like the phone a lot. Its camara is excellent and takes great pictures. It's very simple and easy to operate. I'm not a savvy when it comes to phones and computers, but this one is easy to navigate. It charges pretty fast, too. The fingerprint reader it's great and you can do several fingerprints. I have one star because, I have not used the face recognize yet, but I'm pretty sure it will work well. I only have this phone for two weeks, but is two occasions, I couldn't turn on the phone, the battery was full, it was working fine, and then that happened. Then few days later the same thing happened. Maybe it came diffected. I will ask for a replacement. Otherwise, it's a great phone!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"First time using a pixel phone, previously used a samsung. I love the design, is easy to use and has amazing night view.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Neat and compact smartphone. Reverting back to a smaller size phone from 6.2 to 5.8 wasn't as bad as thought. Battery life 👍🏾. Gaming on this is smooth. Audio could be better but I'm good with that. Over all it's a damn great phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
My husband loves his new phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Everything works great but still trying to figure out all the features. I've used it for a few months but lately my bottom icons, on the home screen, keep shifting. And/or if I open up a different app it randomly will replace one of the home screen icons - like phone - which is becoming annoying. I don't know if I inadvertently changed a setting or if an update caused this shift. I will update this review if I figure it out",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Upgraded from a flip phone(Fred Flintstone enters the 21st century)to this one and it's just what I need.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is my first smart phone. Fingerprint doesn't work, no face recognition. This is my first smart phone, I'm feeling my way through it & learning it bit by bit. I'm not a big cell phone fan & refuse to ""get hooked"" to a cell, so I'm in no rush. I assume it's a good phone but not a good person to ask.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Physically this phone is great, battery life is excellent. The issue is with the app that comes with the phone. Google has had tons of complaints about their messaging app, but they haven't done a thing about it. I actually need a phone that can text, and text reliably so most likely will be returning it if Google don't get their act together.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was expecting disappointment for $350, but this is really good for the price. Charge lasts several days if you don't use it very often, last the whole day if you're streaming music and browsing. I'm sure that if you're used to premium $800 handsets with 90hz+ refresh rates and blisteringly fast processors you'll probably notice a difference switching to this. For someone like me who's been using midrange phones consistently for the past 10 years, honestly this feels good, zippy even compared to the aging phone I just replaced (a blackberry key one).",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I have a T-Mobile and my SIM worked perfectly!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My wife bought the 4a directly from the Google store. After about three months, there was purple bleeding that started appearing all over the screen. The phone still functions but you couldn't see anything besides purple shades. My wife contacted support and was told to send it in and it would be fixed under warranty. However, after they received it they went back on the warranty coverage. They said the phone screen was cracked (the phone has been in a case and has a screen protector). In the initial call to support we had sent photos of the phone to show the screen issue, none of which show any kind of screen crack. My wife requested photos of the cracked screen to which out agent ""Irene"" would not provide as it is in a different department. Irene then told us she would call back after a day or two to help further resolve the issue. After a few days we don't hear back so again we call in. The next agent can't do anything because it is Irene's case. We ask for a supervisor to which we are told they are in a meeting. We request a call back from a supervisor and are told to expect a call within 24-48 hours. Instead of calling us back Irene send us an email saying we have til the 16th to decide what we want to do, phone returned to us more damaged than before or pay for a new screen. We respond to the email that we were originally told it was covered by warranty and have had a very frustrating experience and we would like to get a call back from a supervisor. Again, Irene goes silent and doesn't respond. We receive no call backs as promised so we call in again the next day. Same story different day, supervisor is in a meeting and will call back in 24-48 hours. In summary: This is a decent phone for the price as long as it is working. Not sure if the screen bleeding is a unique issue or widespread. If you ever have to contact customer support prepare yourself for one of the worst experiences as most of the agent just repeat ""Sorry you are experiencing this issue, let me see what I can do to help"" while proceeding to do absolutely nothing about it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"If you're looking a smartphone focused in photos, this is the one. Excellent photos at a great price.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone. Why spend a $1000 on a flagship when all you use it for is for the basics? Battery life is excellent, screen is awesome, phone size is perfect, and the price is right!!! If you are in the market for a budget phone with one of the best cameras, this is the phone to get.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The phone came perfect and arrived on time as I expected and I love Google pixel and if you like Google pixel it'll be a great phone for you,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought it on sale, because I could finally buy one that WASN'T black and that was unlocked and had a headphone jack. That's where the good features end. The fingerprint reader is on the back, so unusable in any wallet or secure place, the quick start instructions are ludicrous and the camera makes images that look overprocessed but the absolutely worst feature is that you can NEVER, EVER leave an app. The guide says all you do is simply swipe to leave, but then there's a left side swipe, a right side swipe, a diagonal swipe right and up, a diagonal swipe left and up....ad infinitum. Yet no swipe actually takes you out of the app you are in, so you end up resetting the device because it's the ONLY way you can leave one app for another one. Sound fun?",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Good phone. Recommended,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I have been using this phone for about a month now and am really happy with it. Chief among the reasons I got it was its camera reviews. It does take great pictures. In addition, Google gives unlimited back up to its Pixel phones. Battery life is solid. I charge nightly and while I drive... but it wouldn't matter. Compared to my previous Moto, this thing sips power. It has 6 gig of ram, which means it will stay speedy for a couple years. There is no external memory... but the 128 gig onboard is plenty. I bought mine unlocked (it will work with pretty much any carrier) and I use it on the Hello Mobile network (they piggyback T-Mobile). It helps to be a bit of a geek to get set up on Hello Mobile (all online, no stores) but once set up it is the cheapest out there. I get 4 lines of unlimited everything for 70 bucks a month.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This phone doesn't work constantly says no service it freezes videos don't play unless they are all pixelated and it won't charge most of the time I would like them to send me a new phone because this one I have had activated less than a week never dropped and it has all sorts of problems,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have now had four of these Pixel 4a's and will never buy and ""a"" version Pixel again and Google has lost all brand loyalty from me because of how they handled it. 1- original purchase with Care Plan - cracked screen 2- replacement 1 of 2 - water damaged screen 3- replacement 2 of 2 - came from mfg with faulty screen waited ~month for google to correct their mistake - definitely lost all brand loyalty here 4- replacement of replacement - dropped in toilet for <1s, 3 days later screen is black. Over ten years ago now, the iPhone 3 was more waterproof than this Pixel 4a. They don't even claim to have any resistance on the website and they are correct. A single small spill will ruin the phone. Even if you dry it out with rice for 2days, the screen's pixels slowly die until the entire screen in not visible/usable. Don't even get me on started on their collection of idiots they call ""customer service"". I bought the extra customer plan along with the brand new phone, didn't get me anything expect the right to buy a replacement phone for $99 and then wait 26 days for it to arrive. I almost went back to apple after this.... but thank goodness for a refurbished, waterproof Pixel 3.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I switched from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to the Google Pixel 4a (not 5G). Overall it is good, but one BIG feature that does not work is the phone ringtone compatibility with a bluetooth-enabled hearing aid. I wear Phonak Audeo M90-RT hearing aids, and on the S8, the phone would ring in my hearing aid with my desired ringtone, but only vibrate on the phone unless the hearing aid was off. Then it would both ring and vibrate on the phone itself. On the Pixel 4a, apparently by design, the only available ringtone options are ring, vibrate or silent. Regardless of the ringtone set, I get some chimes in my hearing aid. I called Google tech support and was told this is working as designed, even though other notifications work as I want. They said it is a difference between media settings and ringtones and ringtones could not do what I wanted and that nobody had reported this issue before. They told me that even though both phones are android, Samsung has made modifications that Google has not. This is a big deal to me, and while I am happy with the phone overall, I probably would not have purchased it if I had known this.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love Google phones and for 350 dollars it's a steal. I paid like 600 for my pixel 2 and this phone has more RAM, more storage, and a headphone jack. It's the perfect phone for people who don't want to spend 900 dollars on the latest flagship phones and don't want to buy a piece of junk. The pixel 4a is easy to use, takes great pictures, and does what I need it to do.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The camera is fantastic, especially for low light and even the night sky. Sound quality for music and calls is good. Battery life is really disappointing. Today mine lasted less than 8 hours after moderate use listening to music, navigating, and playing a game for a 30 minutes. It's only about a month old. I would return it if it weren't outside the window.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Day 1: Unboxing and installation So far so good. It's nice to have a clean phone. Coming from a OnePlus 5T, I sort of am estranged from a smaller size phone. It's big enough but I need to adapting. Fingerprint reader works superb, everything is a smooth install experience. The only downside so far is the thickness of the case but it feels classy and good. The phone without the case is a nice feel. Definitely not a fingerprint magnet. And WOW! My thumb can reach the whole screen again after so many years. An update on camera and software will follow, but there is no bloatware which is very pleasant.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"so it seems like they are making money in servicing this phone, cheap phone, cheaply made, the charge port failed in less than a month. called in, and they make me go to a store ubreakifix, who told me they don't have the part. which seemed a lie, because when I made an appointment online, the part miraculously was there in the same store, less than 10 minutes after being told it is not there (and I got a long parts shortage story when I asked for an explanation.) $90 for charge port replacement. Screen cracked, replacement costs $250. So between the two problems I have, I can just buy a new phone and trash my current phone, total cost $700. I have a good case, took good care of it etc. fell at some strange angle, not sure how.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4a is right in the sweet spot of performance and price. The camera is amazing with the update that Google just released in the beginning of November '20.

"i used to use the flagship smartphone and never think i would buy a budget device, even pixel 3a Received this phone on Saturday morning after i bought this phone for 9 days, is amazingly fast delivery from DHL, so great work DHL! Also i would like to thank amazon to ship this phone to HK, must also do that for every product My previous phone was pixel 4, i would expect to have a bad experience with pixel 4a but didn't happen. Same great google experience and hardware on pixel 4a, it's the most important milestone for android.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I use my smartphones for very basic purposes: phone calls (shocking I know), texting, taking photos, music and podcasts, reading email, and a little web browsing. I am tired of how huge android phones are becoming. I previously had a moto G5 plus, and that was the largest I ever wanted my phone to be. I want to be able to use my phone one handed and I want it to completely fit in my pockets. The pixel a line is the only option of budget android phones that are reasonably sized. Every other budget option from other companies is now 6.5+ inch screens. I don't want that big a phone. Currently, if you want a good midrange device that isn't giant, this is the ONLY option. I even put a case on this thing and it's still slightly smaller than my previous Moto G5 plus. And fortunately, Google has done a great job with the phone. As mentioned above, I'm not a power user, so I can't comment on pushing the phone to its limits, but so far, its plenty fast, has an amazing screen, can be used with one hand, and fits in my hand and pockets. It does everything I want it to, and because its a google phone, isn't bogged down by unwanted bloatware.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"The camera is the best I ever used, it corrects all my mistakes, lighting, shaking. When you pan the video, I don't see any distortion like all my older phones. Shockingly good camera. The lack of direct wifi hdmi to rokutv/monitor is very limiting. I wanted to use my cell as my home computer and internet data source, all in one device. There is no work around with chrome cast without a home wifi network. For rural users this may not be possible. I hope there will be an update. My only work around is to get a new plan with unlimited hotspot at 5mbs.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It is disappointing because I really enjoyed the phone and its set up but after only 2 months of normal use, I dropped it - with a case and screen protector from only 30""- it completely shocked the inside. I'm aware that this is a bargain phone because it's so cheap but to me, this is unacceptable in a smartphone. My iPhone 7 before this lasted for 3 years without a case and dropping it many times from taller heights without any issue. Clearly poorly made. In addition, Google was not helpful and said they would not pay the $130 to fix it. Poor customer service - never had any experience like this with Apple. I attached pictures of how the phone looks (only took the case off for the picture)",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

So I had to send mine back because of OLED uniformity issues. One side of the screen was not as bright as the other and it had horrible black smearing on low brightness when scrolling. It also had a lot of color shift issues when just moving the phone ever so slightly. It shifted to almost all colors of the rainbow. Does anyone have similar experiences?,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Lots of screen issues. Poor sensitivity in areas, ended up with some faulty hardware (pressure issue) while phone was a month old (no outward signs of damage) that turned the screen splotchy colors. Also poor durability- Dropped the phone a couple weeks after the screen was replaced under warranty, and it completely popped off and shattered underneath the screen protector. Will cost about $200 to replace the screen. I have loved my original Pixel in the past, but I will be going back to an older version after using the 4a for 2 months.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

The screen are great and camera, well I don`t need to talk about Pixel cameras, they are well known. I will go in more details on my review on Pixel 5. I refunded this one just because of the battery, it said that it might go up to 24 hours... Well that if you don`t use it at all, just to answer calls and that is it. My battery lasted 12 hours, 4 hours of screen use. With normal daily uses, messaging, Whatsapp, facebook now and then, no gaming or heavy photography. With gaming and photo taking. it lasted about 8 hours, with also about 4 hours of screen use. So do you get this or pixel 5? I got pixel 5.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Terrible, terrible customer support. I will never purchase a Google phone again. Worst phone experience I've had. **As an update, my claim has been denied and they are returning my defective, non-functional phone as is.

"I got this to replace my aging Galaxy S7 and I have not been disappointed. This had just about everything I need. The size is very similar to the S7 which was welcomed with the trend of phones getting too big for one hand. It has a headphone jack, a rare feature to find these days 128GB of storage alot of space comes standard, which some phones charge extra for. Makes up for the lack of expandable storage The battery lasts just about all day with moderate to heavy use Amazing fingerprint reader, with masks and the unreliable nature of facial recognition it's nice having a sensor on the back which takes little to no effort to get to Usb c port (note Google uses a different fast charge system than Samsung and others which goes from the large usb A to usb c and instead uses one that goes from usb c to c) Excellent camera, on vacation I was asked by my girlfriend to take the pictures and send it to her since I ""have the better camera"" The only downsides I have (as someone who doesn't game on mobile) No wireless charging, not waterproof and the keyhole camera cut out takes some getting used to.

"I got this as a backup phone but honestly the main reason was for the camera. I LOVE the camera and app that comes with this phone. It takes fantastic images, of course the person using the camera has a lot to do with that, but it has the capabilities I need to take great shots, what ultimately sold me on this was the ability to capture in RAW, if you are into photography, you already know what this means. It has more than enough space on the hard drive to capture lots and lots of photos (including RAW) and videos. The way this phone's camera and app processes pictures is a real treat, and even though there aren't a bunch of lenses, it more than makes up for it in the resulting shots. The phone is small, it fits in my hand nicely, I'm still not used to the fingerprint reader being on the back, my daily phone has a fingerprint reader in the screen.

Five Star phone if it didn't seem to scratch so easy, and I wasn't explicitly searching for a wireless charging phone. Too big of a task to accomplish on a lunch break using Amazon's terrible search results. Foolish me!!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Another great pixel phone! Lightweight with a great battery and camera. This one have full screen upfront and very thin. Great phone!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"What a great phone at a reasonable price. Caveat, this is the first new smart phone I've ever bought. I've had tier 1 smart phones before but had always refused to pay the full price, > 2x the price of this phone new. Thank you Google for producing a reasonably priced phone with great features.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have been an Android fan ever since my guest phone. I got taljed into the iPhone recently and after less than a month I just had enough. I returned it and got the Google Pixel 4a: (I have friends that have this also) BEST decision ever. Now I can use my Fitbit Versa 2 again, ALL features. I love all the features of this phone which I'm still learning. The camera is exceptional. The ""night sight"" feature is phenomenal. The price of this phone is also very appealing. I highly recommend this awesome phone. 👍👍",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"So I was slightly skeptical about this phone. Some of the reviews worried me a bit. I did a month worth of research on finding the perfect budget phone for myself. Everything was pointing to the pixel 4a. I unfortunately didn't do enough research with my last phone which was the moto g7. I absolutely loved the g5 and just assumed I would love that one as well, and no I didn't. So this was like a really nice upgrade for me. I usually use a phone for at least 2 years and couldn't get past a year with that one. So I'm a heavy phone user from streaming, games here and there, camera and social media. I'm not some tech genius but I do my research. Let me tell you some things I love about this phone. Standout Pros- - The price! -The camera, it's absolutely fantastic. I can't get over how much I love it. My photos on my old phone were terrible. Now I can't stop taking pics. - Minimal bloatware. Not a whole lot is preloaded onto this phone which is great. - How light it is. Old phone was so heavy my hand would fall asleep. This is a great weight. -The features, I love some of the great things this phone can do. Such as the picking up of music around you. There are a bunch of things I really enjoy but just go watch a good review on youtube if you want to see them all. Cons- -Extremely crappy case selection lol. Literally that's the only con I have so far and it's a small one. Although I do have to say that everyone was raving about the pixel 4a's battery life. And I have to say it's pretty good. It's about the same as my old phone. It's not insane as I thought it was going to be. It's not a con because it's not bad in any way. Just thought I would mention it's not as mind blowing as it was made out to be. Also I thought I'd mention that my old phone had a 6.2 inch screen and this is obviously smaller. I don't even miss or notice the smaller screen. I was a little hesitant on the smaller screen of the pixel. But almost immediately I didn't even notice the difference. I actually enjoy having a slightly smaller phone. The shipping was great from this seller as well. These were just a few Standout things from an average person like me. I use my phone for absolutely everything and a quality phone is extremely important. I look forward to using this phone for 2+ years at least. I hope some of this helps anyone on the fence!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Awesome, simple and awesome",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I used this phone for 2 weeks with a lot of pleasure. It is fast, makes beautiful pictures and lasted me all day. However, I went running with the phone in my hand and a bit of sweat got on it. The next day the whole screen was blue and black. So a good buy for the price, but be very careful with water.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I am amazed by the quality of this phone, the screen colors, and the speed, overall nothing to complain about. I don't switch phones so often unless it is really needed and I think I am going to keep this for at least 3-4 years. Lacking of 5G and Wireless charging is not an issue",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Excelente cámara e interfaz, android puro. bastante fluido y tamaño perfecto. Lo único que no me encanta es la pantalla, siento que a los colores les falta algo... o una mejor pantalla, tuve el 3a y creo se veía mejor. En general lo amo. ah, y llegó rápido y en excelentes condiciones.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I had the Pixel 3a XL prior to ordering this phone, but my wife needed a better phone, so I ordered this one and gave her my 3a XL as she wanted the larger size. My biggest concern was the screen size difference, but with the slim bezels on the 4a, the overall screen size is really not much different when compared to the 3a XL. You can see a slight difference when you hold them side to side, but in practical terms of use, its very neglible. As for the phone itself... I love it! It has the awesome camera I have come to love with the Pixel lineup, the fingerprint reader is still in place, it has more memory and RAM than the prior model and the size is much more manageable than the 3a XL was. While I do have very large hands, the smaller physical size of the phone is just much easier to handle, and much easier to operate one handed. Prior to my Pixel 3a XL, I had the Huawei Mate 10 Pro - which I absolutely loved. I have also had Nexus and Galaxy phones, as well as a few other more budget friendly phones. For the MONEY - this phone is an absolute slam dunk! Everything you need, nothing you don't. Full Transparency - I am not a gamer, so I can not attest to how it holds up in heavy gaming. But beyond that, it works wonderfully. If there is any downside, it is the battery. Not that it's small... I have gotten through all day on more than one occasion. However, with my slightly more than average use, I do find myself needing to top off late in the evening. The good news is that in as little as 15 mins, this thing will charge up 50% or more, so it's not a huge deal. If you are going to go out for the evening, just plug it up while you are getting ready, and you'll be more than good to go! They claim that the adaptive battery software will continue to optimize the phone's battery life over time, so we'll see how that goes. But despite that, it is still a phone I would recommend ALL DAY LONG, especially when comparing to other phones in this price point. Oh, and having just one color choice?? What does that really matter, especially when virtually all of us put some sort of case on the phone. There's a good variety of cases to add color, so don't let that stop you.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"After 3 weeks with this phone, I really wanted to like it, it is just too small for my hands, and I have a hard time reading things, I have went back to my oneplus 7 pro. Battery life was AWSOME!! 8+ hrs screen one time on a charge, if I used it normally it would last more than 24hrs on a charge. love the basic Android, and the fingerprint scanner was FAST. I guess it's just not for me",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The camera is simply awesome. I'm someone who would use my dslr pretty much daily to take my kids photos. The Pixel 4A has replaced and bettered my 70D. The creamy bokeh portraits are just too good. This is seriously Canon L series lens territory. (Of course I'm exaggerating a bit as this only applies to sharing the pics on whatsapp I.e screen quality). Also Won't replace dslr zoom lens shot. Great battery life and working flawlessly after a brief 100% submergence in water (don't ask). Note that Ive been using this phone daily for 6 months with zero issues.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone considering its value. Offered a lot of features for an android phone. Simply worth it!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I got this to replace an aging Note 5, which itself was a replacement for a Nexus 5. I never quite felt like the Samsung version of android was something I enjoyed, and I was looking forward to returning to the stock experience I had with the N5, and this one fit the bill. Sure, it doesn't have a few features I was hoping it had, but the honest truth is...did I really need them? For the price ($350 at the time of this review) there simply isn't anything remotely close in my opinion, and I am truly enjoying the experience with this. The fingerprint reader is just practically instant, and the placement on the back is the right place for it. I always hated the Samsung's button fingerprint reader, and it seemed like a crap-shoot whether it would work or not. this one is just darn solid. Camera is great, and the battery life is just unbelievable. Unless you -absolutely- need some of the missing features, like the wireless charging, wide-angle camera or the faster-refresh rate, then this is the one to get. If you do feel like you need those, do make sure you ask yourself if they are worth paying over 2x the cost of this phone for them... This isn't just a great phone for $350, it is a great phone full stop, and if this is the feature set and performance I can now expect at this price point, I will never shell out $1k+ for a phone ever again. I didn't get it through amazon as it was sold out, but I also got the google branded case and that one is also fantastic and highly recommended. I just love that feel of the cloth-like texture and wish I could get something like that for my iPad. And it is washable!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Complete garbage will leave you strande, know issue with the phone is the GPS just random stops working. Doesn't matter what app or settings the location services for the phone just stop working and only way to fix it is with a factory resetting.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've had this phone since the end of November and it is now March. If everything worked on it, I'd rate it a 4. But there are so many issues! Apps will randomly not open for hours at a time. The Google search bar too. For some reason when playing downloaded music via bluetooth, the music will cut out and get choppy unless my screen is on. Honestly I'm really disappointed I bought this but the problems didn't show up until the return window closed :(",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This phone was very sketchy as soon it booted up there was a VPN software already downloaded on it and several other encrypted applications used to hide traces like DuckDuck Go and other apps to get through firewalls.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I went from a Xiaomi Mi A2 lite, after 3 generations of Samsungs, as they lost value per dollar. The Xiaomi was a much better value and also very comfortable, but the problem with all chinese phones: They don't support all U.S. cell bands! I had service 60% of the time, and never when inside a big building. THE PIXEL?!? Instantly felt comfortable, very lightweight, the perfect size with a big, beautiful OLED screen, very convenient fingerprint sensor with fast unlock, very fluid animations. Oh and the BEST phone camera that AI sharpens and makes pictures look so true to life. It also comes with Android 11, which has some neat features, such as adaptive charging so it charges slowly to save your battery while being full your morning alarm goes off. cons: smaller battery, still says 1day 6 hours on full. plastic backing, but I put a case on it anyway. So far, been very impressed and think the Pixel is the best Android experience there is.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone, high quality, and best price! BEST CAMERA EVER!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great, have absolutely no complaints whatsoever. The size of the phone is perfect the sound is good stereo would be better but no big deal. Camera is very good especially with the dark shot feature",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This was quite a step up for me going from a HTC Desire 526 smart phone to the Google Pixel 4a smartphone. I like the fact that it is unlocked. Never buy a phone that is not. In that way you can take it to the carrier of your choice. I've been with Verizon for 4 years now. And they keep giving me perks for my loyalty so you never bite the hand that feeds you. Now about the phone itself. I like the fact it had a transfer device with it so transferring my files, pics, and contacts was very easy for me and granted I am not real techie but I can do a few things without help. I like the fact it has 128gb of internal memory so no need for an internal micro sd card. Great camera too. I like you can set it to block out telemarketers. It takes very little time to charge it and the charge lasts a very long time. 12 hours approximately depending on what you do with your phone. I am NOT a gamer as I view it as a big waste of time. The phone has limitless potentials. I like the OLED screen too. It's very light and thin which is nice. I do suggest you get a good rubber armor for it which I did. People I talk to ask me what kind of phone I am on now because I sound really good on it. You won't experience drop calls on this phone no matter where you are. I'm 68 years young and hope this will be the last phone I will ever own until the day they put me in a box. It has a great assortment of ringer sounds to choose from or if you don't want to be disturbed you can set it to that too. Great Wi-Fi too and you can turn it into your own private Wi-Fi hotspot if you choose to do so. Which I think is very cool. I don't think you can go wrong with this phone as like I said before the potentials of what it can do seem to be limitless. Also the learning curve is quite easy and it's an Android. Iphones are just a name and you pay dearly for it. I'll stick to Android phones. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a very functional and efficient/proficient phone. Buy it. You won't regret it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pros: - Small enough to properly fit in my hand Cons: - Atrocious battery life. (And I don't use it that often) - The finicky ""swiping"" you have to do for everything. 10/10 would not recommend.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Super easy setup from my old Android phone!!! USB C to USB C and in a few minutes all my apps, pictures, contacts, and files were transferred over to the Pixel 4a! And the camera is flagship!!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone has become a very good solid phone. I had my doubts about it being so small. I'm coming from. 6.3 inch motorola. For the phones size it is incredibly agile and a small powerhouse. The battery life is decent. On any given day the battery will last me all day with using GPS, calls and texts. I usually end up with 50-35% at the end of the day (depending on how much I use it). The camera is astounding. It is extremely powerful. The night sight and astrophotography settings are fantastic. Standard photos are very detailed texture and skin tone wise. The sound was very surprising, very good on not only low and midrange sounds, but clear high tones. There is a supposed sound amplifier app built in, but doesn't seem to do anything. The screen is great, color is very deep, and vibrant. All in all I was very surprised on everything this phone can do. Oh and not to mention you can actually uninstall apps you don't want that are built in, instead of just disabling then.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"For the price (being about a third of current big name flagship phones) this phone is a great option. But, there are a few things missing that I wish it had. As an amateur photographer, I like having a phone that can fill in for (or replace) a pocket camera for those everyday pictures when it isn't convenient to carry a full size DSLR. So the good news is that while the camera isn't quite as nice as some of the most expensive phones out there, it's easily as good as most pocket cameras as recently as just a few years ago. You will not be disappointed with the results from this camera. But that does lead into one of the phone's drawbacks, the lack of a micro SD card slot. Without one, you are limited to the internal storage of the phone itself, and once that is full, you'll need to backup your files and delete them from the phone to make room. With 128 GB of internal storage, most casual users will not run out of space quickly, however, unless you are recording tons of videos all the time. The lack of a removable card slot is mitigated somewhat by the inclusion of a USB OTG adapter that will allow you to attach a thumb drive or other USB accessory to the phone. This will let you easily backup your files to an external drive to free up space on the phone, if it becomes necessary. It also allows you to easily connect USB accessories and peripherals like a keyboard or projector, for example. The screen is a good size, extending almost to the edges (but not quite wrapping around like a Galaxy phone). The rear facing ""selfie"" camera is embedded in the screen, so that's a nice modern styling touch common to other current generation phones. The front facing camera and flash LED light are housed in a pod on the back of the phone which protrudes approximately 1.5mm from the back surface. This is sort of an unsightly break in an otherwise smooth, aesthetically pleasing housing. I am sure the aftermarket will step up with phone cases that protect this little pod from dings and scratches. The screen itself curves down at the edges to meet a thin plastic bezel to transition into the plastic case back. Additionally the fingerprint scanner is conveniently located in the center of the phone back where your index finger naturally lands when holding the phone. Every other phone I have used has had occasional scanning errors but this one has unlocked easily every time. I'm not sure if that means it would be easy to fool the scanner, but it is undoubtedly more convenient and so far is the best fingerprint scanner I've used on a phone, so Google really nailed this feature. The speakers sound a little hollow when held in the hand listening to music, but they improve when the phone is laid on a hard surface like a desk. There is a TRRS audio in/out jack so you can connect headphones, speakers, a microphone or a speaker/mic headset, among other things. Some niche apps (like certain amateur radio apps) require this jack so it's good that it's present. Actual phone audio is excellent. I simply swapped my micro sim out of my old phone and into this one and it immediately recognized it and is able to make and receive calls as if nothing changed. I get no complaints about low volume or poor sound from people on the other end of the line either. Another feature I miss from my old phone is WiFi calling. This allows you to make and receive voice calls over a WiFi router when a phone network connection is unavailable. It's a great feature that I have found very useful many times, but sadly it doesn't appear to be present in this phone (at least, not on the OEM phone app). Screen clarity, color and resolution are all too good to complain about. Touch sensitivity is good. Like most phones in the last 5 years or so, there is no way for the end user to easily replace the battery. And with the rapid development of Android, your phone's processing power will probably be obsolete before you significantly wear out the battery. I typically charge my phones every night and take them off the charger in the morning. I've had phones last for 3 years, but that was the absolute longest I've managed to go before upgrading. And by that time my old phone was struggling to run the current Android build. Still, I really, really wish modern phones still had a provision for changing the batteries. Okay, so what else? It's a Google phone so you are going to get a cleaner version of Android than you would on a Samsung or other brand because there isn't going to be as many bloatware apps. It doesn't have a Qi charging coil inside so you won't be able to use wireless charging. This is a feature I liked from my other recent phones because you can put a little piece of tape over the USB port to keep pocket lint from getting in, and just charge it wirelessly. With the 4a, you'll have to plug it in to charge it, and that means the plug will have to be open to the elements. Overall it's a really nice phone when considered on its own. When compared to other phones (costing a lot more) it lacks some features, but for the price you get a lot of great features and functionality. If you are looking for an android phone that checks almost all the boxes and will save you a lot of money versus a flagship phone, this is a solid choice.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"When I dropped our old mobile phone service to move to Project Fi, new compatible phones were necessary. The Pixel2 had just come out and was my choice to replace my family’s phones. The monthly phone bill was very low compared to our old service and a year’s worth of the savings paid for our phones. After two years, we upgraded to Pixel 4XL sets. When need arose for an additional phone, I again researched available options, ultimately choosing the Pixel 4a. Admittedly, I wanted something less expensive than another 4XL, plus size appropriate for smaller hands with a good camera and no degradation in performance. The 4a has been a perfect choice. It’s smaller and easier to hold. The camera seems to be the equal of its bigger counterpart’s much acclaimed camera. Not everyone loves the feature, but I’m partial to phones with a fingerprint sensor on the back, like on the 4a. Something else I don’t see all the time on inexpensive phones is the ability to make contactless payments (NFC). Old style headphones are compatible too with the 4a’s headphone jack. At this price, it wasn’t a surprise, or very disappointing, to learn that the phone isn’t rated as water resistant. I highly recommend Google Fi phone service and Google Pixel phones. Considering the savings, compared to high-end Android phones, the 4a is an intelligent choice for anyone that wants most of the perks of the bigger sets in a less sexy package (plastic versus glass). Five stars.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone overheats, the system starts shutting down. Camera, sound, etc. When receiving a call, the phone rings, however, the icon to answer bows not show up.

The made me spent several hours every day trying to troubleshoot. And now, 2 months and 3 weeks after I purchased it through Amazon at full price, Google says that since I did not buy it from them, they do not respond for the warranty of the phone. NEVER AGAIN!!!

"This is my first new phone in 6 years, and I am coming from the Apple environment. The phone itself is very sleek looking and I think is a good ""medium"" size phone. I wear women's clothing and it fits in my pocket, but it also isn't small/flimsy/too light. When turning the phone on for the first time, it prompted a great tutorial on how to use it's user interface, as well as made it easy to find when I skipped it and then wanted to look at it afterwards. Quick charge was VERY quick, under 30 mins! I have not used fingerprint reader or face recognition, nor do I plan to, so I have not reviewed them.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My old iPhone SE died and i upgraded to the Pixel. It works, but I wish I would have bought the new SE instead. Battery life is good, camera is nice, it works as a smartphone, I like that it still has a headphone jack, but I expected more. The screen doesn't always respond (I try to expand from my home screen to view all apps, but it won't expand). I've already had to force restart it when it got stuck in an infinite startup loop (had it for only a month). I trained ""ok google"" for my voice, but it never works, however when I was listening to an audiobook in the car, for some reason the name ""Able"" activated google voice every time- super annoying. The first day, the alarm clock didn't go off (found out this is a known issue), and I was late for work. The top volume on the speaker is laughably quiet, so don't expect to be able to talk on speakerphone in the car. I can't seem to configure my work and personal stuff to be on the same screen (it forces me to segment them, so I have two gmail apps and two calendar apps - might be cool for some folks, but I don't like it). The fingerprint reader is on the back of the phone for your pointer finger, which isn't ergonomic at all. Google maps is slow to respond to route changes. I'm not a die hard Apple person, but I've found the iphone SE from years ago to be superior in nearly every way. In 2020 at this price point from Google, I expected more, now I'm stuck. I do not recommend this phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I’m hoping the community or seller can help me with a couple of issues I had with the phone that made it a deal breaker. My cell service is T-Mobile. Ever phone I’ve had I always block my outgoing caller ID in settings. I leave that setting enabled at all times. For family and friends I edit the contact with two entries for the same number. So if their # is 222-222-2222, I have that number and I also have the same # as *82 222 222 2222. The *82 unblocks my caller ID so the friend can see it’s me calling. This does not work on the Pixel 4a that I had. If I make the call with the *82 prefix the number still shows up as blocked or restricted. Spent a couple of hours with Google chat trying to resolve the issue to no avail. Also contacted T-Mobile with same results. The other issue was the adaptive charging which was enabled on the phone. Alarm set for 8AM and charging began after 9PM. Screen would show “Adaptive Charging” but would still fast charge the phone within an hour. Again used Google chat but was never able to get the adaptive charge to work. Just wondering if there is someone out there than can help me with these issues. I have to believe it’s some error on my part but haven’t been able to figure it out. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I love this phone. Please keep in mind, I've never owned a flagship phone, usually sticking to phones I could buy outright for less than $200. That said, I was ready for a new phone and did a lot of research. I also had a chance to spend some time with a Pixel 4 to compare it. So the following are my impressions: First off, what's different from the Pixel 4: You are missing the aluminum frame, the facial recognition, the edge squeeze, the water resistance, a specific camera lens and some camera features, wireless charging, and an 800 series processor. I think that's about it. The thing is, other than the water resistance, I personally don't miss any of that. What you get in return is a slightly bigger screen, a better battery, and a brighter screen (you have to use adaptive brightness for it to work). This is also a fair bit lighter. Also a personal preference is that I prefer the fingerprint reader over facial recognition. For me it's the perfect little phone. Full disclosure, I paid about $260 since I bought it from Amazon Warehouse. Nonetheless, this phone hits all the right spots for me. It is light, it has a clear and bright screen, it is fast, takes amazing pictures, it isn't bloated with preinstalled apps, and is future proof in that you can update for 3 years, the sound is pretty great, and honestly I can't find much to complain about. The only thing I wish this had was the water resistance. Accidents happen. Also keep in mind that this is plastic with an outdated Guerilla 3 screen. Buy a case. Buy a screen protector. If you do, I can't see why this phone won't be a great phone for you unless you only buy the $1000 flagships with all the bells and whistles, in which case, why are you even reading this review? One last thought. The battery is fine by me. I can make it through the day and longer with moderate use. No wireless charging, but it charges from zero to full in pretty much less than an hour, so I always find time within the day to plug it in and then I'm good to go. Usually at dinner time or whatever when I don't want to be disturbed anyway. Had a chance to to go with the Pixel 4, chose to go with this instead (mostly because the Pixel 4 screen is waaaaay to dim). Thanks Google for this amazing cheap phone!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"This phone for one thing has an awesome camera which I use for everything. I was getting so used to not getting clear sharp or correctly exposed photos with the Moto I had before. I struggled to get a clear closeup or sometimes even distant photos with the Moto. With this phone I am amazed, I get nicely exposed and clear pictures in all light levels. I use my phone to document items and even documents using the photo scan app and it works perfectly. I couldn’t have done that with Moto it just wouldn’t happen the camera and app on Motorola is horrible and I got no help from Motorola at all it’s a defect numerous people have. With this camera I have none of that the pics are just crystal clear and I don’t have to stand on my head and pray just for a good pic. Thanks Google. I like google everything it just works! Thank you! I can get perfect pictures for my reviews on Google maps and Amazon etc. I couldn’t do that before! The camera is important to me because I don’t carry my big digital camera anymore it’s just to much hassle. I want a nice clear picture taking camera that’s easy to use and quick! I use the camera more than phone calls and text so I really love this phone! I find that the camera functions can do very extensive things and for once they are easy to use which I didn’t have before. Google please keep it up make a camera that is good and easy to use and just works! I haven’t commented on the actual phone functions as I just live for the camera! I use it to document my old pictures and convert them to digital and store them on Google Photos, love it. I’ve done the old way trying to store on a desktop computer on hard drives, discs and flash drives and a scanner. Not anymore I had to re digitize my old paper pictures to google and I can access them effortlessly using Google Photos. I’m sold, I use Google for everything now. I’m 65 and this digital apps, camera phone and Google pics is just so much easier to do. The camera itself works excellent and menus are so much better and easier to use. I will probably be back to revisit this review as I discover more things about the Pixel 4a. Thanks again for a good phone at a reasonable cost.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
My wife liked it. The small and handy phone looks very trendy and manageable.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love it so much, I have the pixel 2 before, the new phone have a bigger screen But the phone have a weird things, the app logo have been flow on the top of the screen",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is a nice phone. I love how light it is and how bright the screen gets. The fingerprint reader is in a comfortable location, and the touchscreen is really responsive. The phone handles all the apps I install (my son is a gamer, so that includes some big apps) and it has great signal all the time. I added a case for $15 that feels really solid and has a built in screen protector. I recommend this!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Nice fingerprint reader,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"While the Google Pixel 4a might be a no-frills phone, it's a really nice one! I switched to it from a very basic Android A20 and the big difference is the Google's massive memory and camera. It's just right for me. I don't miss facial recognition since I don't use it. My A20 doesn't charge wirelessly either, so I don't miss that, either. I do appreciate the fingerprint sensor and the camera is absolutely fantastic. My A20 doesn't have a lot of memory so it can get slowed down due to the amount of photos I've got stored on it. That's not a problem for the 4a. It does take a few seconds for the photos to be ready, but I don't mind that at all. You get three years worth of upgrades with this economically priced phone, and you don't get massive amounts of bloatware like my Android has. I really appreciate that!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Phone has been great for my wife. Takes great pictures and the battery life has been awesome. We are running into an issue with the SIM card not being detected. I've even ordered a new SIM from my carrier and the same issue occurs. That is the only reason for a 3 star review. If support can resolve the issue, then I will adjust.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
All three products arrived in one package was the new phone the case and the screen protector. Delivered within 3 days of my order I couldn't be happier.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Spent over 7 hours in the T-mobile store only to learn the phone is not compatible. Otherwise it seems like a great phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've had my phone a couple of months. It replaced a Moto Droid Turbo 2, which was a great phone. I chose the 4a in part because it's a smaller unit. I don't want a cigar box in my pocket. The compromise was on how narrow it is -- a bit too narrow, less screen, not as substantial in the hand. But those are tradeoffs. Nice to have a clean Android install and updates! PROS Comfortable size Good display Responsive and smooth action Battery life is excellent - I get 2-3 days but watch little video, play no games, keep location off unless I need it Camera has pretty good night mode I don't use a ""wrapper"" on my phone - it slides in/out of pocket easier ""bare"". Dropped it once, no damage. Fingers crossed. (I don't use face recog or fingerprint reader) GREAT price! CONS A bit too narrow Display is not as good as the reviews would have you believe Ditto on the camera -- I'm not very happy with it. The controls are clumsy, including the exposure hotspot. I really miss the Turbo 2's ""wave your hand"" to see notifications. Seems to me this would be easy to implement on all phones. Screen is slow to populate when booting It's probably Android or the app, not the phone, but it often plays the wrong ringtones on the alarm The only other phone I considered seriously (I looked at a lot, ""in person""!) is the Samsung S21 (not 5G) at a higher price. If I were to do it again I might be swayed to get that instead. The camera is just better as is the screen. But I'll be honest -- $349 for an unlocked 4a is hard to beat! Unless your phone is a really big deal to you, the 4a does the job nicely. One last thing: I'll never buy another locked phone again!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Videos get cut off on the bottom, can't read sub titles. Settings are different from previous models, pain to adjust volume. Have to double press button to get it to change while in video. Quality is just not great, google is falling behind, I think it's time to check out samsung again.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Haven't seen a good smartphone, fairly priced, all-rounder, since the Moto Z Play. I don't really miss SD cards because they simply suck, and honestly I can't even remember the last time I used one for something that wasn't a PinePhone. Straight up installed Graphene OS for what, I hope, should be obvious reasons. The camera is pretty good even without the Google Camera, I have been using Open Camera with the camera2 API. The battery, while not amazing, is enough for one day and a bit with medium usage (but do keep on mind I'm not using the stock ROM!). Camera bumps are annoying, but I can't really complain, since there's only so much you can fit in a smartphone. Thanks for keeping the headphone jack, the quality is average, but definitely not bad. Snappy, of course, I don't really know why are smartphones getting so expensive and absurd with the hardware. Very fast and accurate fingerprint reader.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I splurged on myself and got this phone. Loved this phone so so much. The fingerprint reader is an amazing feature! Pictures are great just a little bloatware. But today at work I knocked it off my desk. Three feet high and it landed face down and the screen is shattered. I didn't throw it, not force was involved, it just fell off when I moved some papers. I've had plenty of cell phones and never have I cracked a screen. And, since it's a new model, the screen repair costs between $200-250. I didn't get the insurance because I've never needed it before. The case on it is a hard case with a slight lip coming over the screen for extra protection. Very disappointed in this product. It got two stars because it's a great phone, just a crappy screen. I recommend getting some insurance if you buy it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone for price, screen could be a bit brighter!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Pixel 4a is lightweight and good for use.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Love this phone! It's super fast, with plenty of memory! Camera takes great pictures, videos, plenty of features, and battery last all day, and there is no exageration there. I leterally use this thing all day at work, running multiple apps, gps, music, etc. Nice and thin in pocket. I haven't found a flaw yet!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I ordered this to be used with my drone so I didn't have to install the drone software on my actual phone, but I am so pleased with how well it works that I gave it to my son instead. The price and features make it the perfect phone for people who want the smartphone experience with out the expensive price tag. It works just as well as my S20 Ultra, but the size makes it easier for my son to hold and put in his pocket. He loves being able to stream movies and songs, and I love that I can reach him easily. The camera works very well, the screen is bright and has a beautiful picture, the battery lasts all day, the fingerprint scanner is better than other phones I've used, and it's quite durable. The only downside I've found is that the processor is not as quick as the expensive phones. Everything else about it makes it a great phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I got this phone for my wife a month ago and she is loving it. She like how she have the ability to screen calls from unknown number and also to mess with the kids lls,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I had a Pixel 3 and the battery started to drain really quickly. I was a little skeptical about this phone but for the price point it's really great! The battery life is amazing for this phone and it's about the same size as my Pixel 3. I'm really pleased with this purchase.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great upgrade from Pixel 3a which my son has now. Battery life lasts all day, love the stereo speakers, camera is great and no lag in performance. Perfect size in hands.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I had the Pixel3 and it was ok but in 4a they have improved everything. Fantastic phone and especially the camera.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
No longer do I have to carry a brick with me.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Returned/waiting on replacement because the phone is listed as “new” but received scratched fingerprinted phone out of an open box.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Battery life is not great, and the user interface sometimes leaves a great deal to be desired but ultimately, this was a fine unlocked phone for the price.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Super fast, she is coming from a Samsung S8 and I have the S9. This phone is pretty awesome, we are willing to give up our wireless charging to have a fast phone at a cheaper price. Sucks it isn't at least water proof but we'll take that chance I guess. Anyways wife is happy and I just ordered one for myself.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The resolution is amazing. The phone is very fast and on my network it is downloading a 234Mbps! Apps work perfect. I even play EVE online with it. Looks and runs the game amazing. Streaming tv apps are smooth and gorgeous. Really love this phone. I would highly recommend it to anyone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
- Bluetooth is finicky- it drops and picks up - especially when dialing or when someone is calling you. I have Jabra headset- it worked flawlessly with my Moto G- but not with this phone. - No Flashlight gesture. Know how you shake your phone twice to tur,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is my first android phone and I can say the 5.8 inch makes the phone size perfect on my hands. The light and slim body is a plus. Camera - The camera is comparable to that of the iPhone 11 Pro Max the Samsung Galaxy s20 Ultra. This is one of the only budget phones that has night mode which beats the more expensive SE that doesnt have it. Speakers - At this price, you wouldn't expect the speaker to sound. Believe it or not, the stereo speaker sounds pretty good. Mids are decent, bass are present. Microphone also works great. Cons: No wireless charging. That's it. That's the only con. Other than that, this phone is suitable for those looking for phones thats geared towards value. If you are a student, this phone is for you.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Perfect for the price. Feels good in hand and Android 11 is a blast.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It's a 350$ unlocked smart phone. No frills with a good camera perfect for a person who doesn't want to spend 1200$ on something that becomes a paperweight in 2 years. Camera is great some complained about the processing time on normal photos but for me they seem to be done instantly. Must have been an update. Gaming is pretty limited in this device. Again it's 350$ the pixel is meant for someone that wants world connectivity with a good camera. Battery life isn't bad. I don't spend more then 2 hours a day on it. And it lasts almost a day and a half. Charger seems fairly quick at roughly 45 min to go from high teens to the 80% range. Bought two phones and had one black screen of death after 3 days of use. Luckily Amazon exchanged it no questions asked. This is why I purchased it from Amazon rather than direct through Google. Google will make you jump through hoops and do repairs first. This is why I gave the phone 4 stars. Seems to be a re accuring problem with the 4a.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Takes awesome pictures. Nice phone. Battery is avg,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have used iphone for years, but they just keep getting more expensive. I’ve decided to switch to pixel because its a 3rd of the cost. I am still learning the ins and outs of the operating system, but there is nothing on here that I cant so that I could on iphone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Best Google phone, new and sealed, recommend it to everyone - 5 stars",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Cheap quality. Fingerprint reader is not placed in a comfortable position. Maybe I'm biased but I didn't enjoy the experience.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is probably the best cell phone I've ever owned, and I used to have a flagship LG and an iPhone 8. It's lightweight with a great looking display and a fast processor. The battery lasts all day with normal use and it charges very fast. The camera is top notch in all situations, even outside at night. So it doesn't have wireless charging capability or a telephoto lens, big deal. I don't need either. In my opinion this is a great phone and at $349, it's a steal!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great camera. Ok battery life. Softwares not so great. Just 6 month old phone misbehaves sometimes. Good operating system. Unbeatable price for the camera.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone for $$. Camera is very good. Sound clarity excellent. Wish it were waterproof. Upon further review this is the most irritating phone I've ever had. Whoever designed the swipe left back ""feature"" should be fired.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
New in sealed box,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Finally a decent phone below 6 inch of display. Photos come out amazing. The only disappointment is no facial recognition and the battery that does not last too long... Barely a day with medium usage... However, it charges very quickly.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
So far i am pleased with the cell phone but the baytery last 2 days with moderate use.that is one half the time of my previous phone but longer than a lot of iphones. I have data turned off and only use wifi.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I haven't really had any high-end phone experience before so I can't compare this to more expensive ones, but from what I experienced so far, nothing stands out beside the great camera, but it also feels nothing is lacking. For the $350 price point, I have no complaint on this. Some people talk about battery life being lower than their expectation, but I feel it lasts fairly.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I was going to buy this phone but not having exspanable storage was a deal breaker... This phone has everything I want except 1 crucial feature. Expandable storage would have made me buy this phone easily.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I really like the 4a. I figured what the heck at just $349 and with all the great reviews I figured I'd take a chance on it. Glad I did. I bought mine from Google because they had them in stock and Amazon didn't at that time. I really like the small size. The camera in this thing is every bit as good or better than my expensive Nikon digital camera. I don't know if it's the internet service or if it's the phone either way this thing is fast. Some people are complaining about having to swipe the screen to navigate so if they'll go to settings, then to accessability and then system navigation you'll find the old 3 button navigation system that you can switch to. If you take the time and go through all the settings you can find a lot stuff to adjust to make using this phone a lot easier to use. The battery in my opinion is fine. I've been using my 4a since early this morning and its 6:42 pm now and I still have 40 percent battery power remaining. I purchased the LK screen protectors for mine here on Amazon and they fit and work perfectly and were easy to install. You can't beat the price at $9.99 for 4 of the tempered glass protectors that include an installation frame, wet and dry wipes, a tool to remove air bubbles and lint picker uppers. They have a good installation video on the LK website. I also purchased a case cover and holster with a belt clip on Amazon. It also fits perfectly. You can find it if you search on Amazon under ""Encased Pixel 4a belt clip case (thin armor) slim grip cover with holster for Google Pixel 4a - black"". They're only $16.99. The case cover is flexible and it covers the edge of the phone all the way around. The rubber case feels better to the touch than the hard plastic and it's not slick. No problem getting to the fingerprint reader and the camera lens is not blocked. It's a great little phone in my opinion.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Google Pixel 4a is ta good size if you like smaller phones. The 5.81-inch display might seem big in the ads, but the small bezels and punch-hole camera help make this a truly one-handed phone. I wasnt wishing for a larger phone while scrolling watching videos. I prefer plastic phones , since switching back to plastic from a super-breakable glass phone gave me a sense of freedom I never had with more expensive phones. I didn’t even need a case. The phone isn’t as slippery, and it’s more durable than a glass-covered phone if I were to drop it- altho I didn't test this. Very decent battery life, and a very nice camera for the price point. The Google Pixel 4a also has a headphone jack. 'nuff said.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Awesome phone. I love what google has done with the new pixel. Normally I’m an iPhone gal and definitely don’t care for androids, but this google phone is top notch, especially for the unbeatable price. It has a great camera, superb battery life and many convenient features. Size is perfect and I added a case for protection. If you want an outstanding phone that doesn’t break the bank, get this one",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Turned on the phone and it's broken. It's stuck on the reboot. So it's deadlocked. Waited a week for the phone that doesn't work. What a joke.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I know, am out of date, bought a Pixel 4a (4g) after my ""antique"" Samsung 5 s quit. So, after only 6 weeks, this phone LOCKED UP, would not even turn off. Finally managed to get it to do ""factory reset"", lots of hassle there as requires re-doing, well, everything. That is pathetic. Appears is was a ""system update"" that caused this, but could not even find the ""safe boot"" mode, does not seem to even be available given the lock you re-boot cycle. Otherwise. USED to like this phone..",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I really like that it has many features and options. many of them are quite surprising. However, it can be a little more difficult to navigate than I like. It is also to easy to swipe things away when your intentions are to navigate to another text, scroll up or down and choose an item when working with one hand. Going back to a previous page is also tricky at times. It really is a very good phone but can stand some improvements.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It was exactly what I expected, just like the previous Spigen cases I've used. In the past, I tried other brands of cases but always came down to using the Spigen. They are plain, simple, comfortable, and do what they are made for. This time when I got a new phone, I went straight to the Spigen because I knew exactly what to expect, which is nothing fancy, but effective.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"First things first, we're not tech geeks by any stretch of the imagination. My wife had been using an older phone that didn't have much memory and was something of a dinosaur in today's world. When this became available, we picked it up, even if somewhat reluctant. For us, it's been a really smooth transition. As with most gadgets, learning is fairly intuitive and trial-and-error. Set up was easy to link her older android phone to this one. We've never had a Google Pixel phone before and, truth be told, never even heard of them before. Again, for us, the set up was easy (a huge plus), and figuring out how to swipe, use various shortcuts, and essentially learn the phone was a pleasant and rarely frustrating experience. I can't tell you how important that is for us. The photographs, as advertised, are very sharp and as good as promised. I'll skip the concept of a phone being a great camera, but for us, especially given her old phone (and my iPhone 6s), these are really nice photos. The essentials - the battery life is great and it's a quick charge (as is the case with most new phones), we don't do facial recognition, and the dimensions are good for her hands. We quickly picked up a case with screen covers, which eased our worries about drops or damages. Since we've had it, we've been really surprised and happy with how easy it is to work with, how much of an upgrade it is, and how easy it's been for her to acclimate to. That last thing is the most important, and for the very reasonable price, that makes this upgrade a really nice one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was pleasantly surprised by this phone. I have used a Samsung phone for years. I was happy with my Samsung, but I really, really like my pixel. The security is excellent. The photos are great, and it has all the backing of Google.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Recommend this phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"While this isn't the highest end phone on the market, it has really great features, a very decent processor, and unexpectedly long battery life for the size. The battery life may be benefiting from the smaller OLED screen. The finger print sensor works consistently and is easy to reach. This phone is chalk full of the latest Google features. Granted some of them are gimmicks, but you'll be able to impress your friends with a 350USD phone. The camera is probably the pixel 4as biggest selling point. The funny thing is it isn't really the camera itself that makes it good. It's all the software that allows 1 camera to emulate the functions of a lot of 4-camera phones. And this emulsion is pretty good. For instance, the portrait mode is able to give that depth is field effect without a depth sensor. I didn't even buy this phone for the camera, so I like the fact that I'm not paying for 6 cameras but I'm still getting the same functions.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This got here super fast, battery lasts way longer than my old phone. Way less annoying notifications, and the camera is great!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Cannot get this phone to connect to a PC or Chromebook. I also cannt get Google to erase my old phone and see only my new Pixel 4. It will connect to a laptop with the cable it came with but only to charge. It does not have an SD card either. I would appreciate anyone who can tell me how to transfer files via cable from my Pixel to my Acer Chromebook.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
THIS PHONE WAS GREAT FOR 1 OR 2 MONTHS THEN I HAVE SO MANY TROUBLES WITH THE SIM CARD READER. I HAVE TO REBOOT MANY TIMES TO HAVE SIGNAL AGAIN. MAYBE IT IS A FIRMWARE ISSUE BUT YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO THE NEXT GOOGLE UPGRADE.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The Google Pixel 4a is just great! Nice design. Good size. Not too bulky. 5.8 inch size is just right. Light weight. Swift and snappy performance. Decent battery. Very nice camera. Good regular updates. Perfect phone for me!!! I have 2 of them!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have been a fan of google and the simplicity in use they had manage to do with the software, in comparison to apple and samsung. However, as mentioned in the headline, while google was able to establish decent hardware components you pay for what you get. I had bought their case and screen protector and still manage to crack my screen from 4 feet and 2 feet off the ground. Huge disappointment in the quality it was built in, the plastic back, the screen itself feels tacky with issues with touch screen sensitivity issues. If you like google phones and are prone to dropping your phone, THE PIXEL 4A LACKS THE CONFIDENCE i wish it deserved. Keep in mind the screen is a huge issue since there is not water resistance and compromised the structural integrity. On top of issues with google, i was unable to write a review in any of their platforms.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"So far, I love it!!! It has good battery life. Let's you know when it is getting too warm. Love my phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"While I work in the space of mobile applications I tend to hold off on upgrading my phone until the last minute of my phone's life. Upgrading to this from the OG Pixel was a great transition. There were things about the other Pixel phones that I didn't like so I waited until one had what I needed. Headphone jack, thank goodness. I'm old and still love having this as an option because I have older equipment here and there that it's just a lot easier. Fingerprint reader on the back of the phone again; this is one thing that the OG Pixel had that I really loved. It became second nature so I really wanted it back. The battery life on this phone is fantastic so far. I would say with moderate use I could probably get 2 days out of it on a charge. It also charges fairly quickly. For performance, it does exceptionally well for the price range and it's all I need. The camera takes pretty great pictures, and does well with portrait mode even better than the iPhone SE. (It recognizes my dog so I'm happy haha). The only downsides to this phone for me would be no wireless charging and it is not 5G ready. I knew this going into it and honestly I can't live without those things for another couple of iterations. The phone is very intuitive and a great experience.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I have been using a iphone since 2007 religiously. I went and bought the iphone 12 and after a few days of using it and watching reviews I decided to finally go try a android phone. I bought the pixel 4a started using it right away I haven't picked up iphone since I got the pixel. I absolutely love it!!!! I have gone from team iphone to team pixel and I'm pretty sure this is going to be my main daily driver phone. I love everything about it. (I did just order the pixel 5) so anyone who is thinking about going from iphone to pixel DO IT!!!! The camera is amazing. The battery life is great. The phone runs very smooth and I love everything about it. I haven't found one thing I don't like yet. And being 2020 and having to wear masks the finger print scanner is a most and perfect!!!!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Enjoying it,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have had this phone about a month. I came from a Moto G5s plus which was a lower end phone than even this one. So, I figured this would be a great step up as other reviews have said. The phone does take excellent pictures unlike my previous phone. However, the manueverability between screens is just cumbersome. The gesture to see all the screens that are open is almost the same as the gesture to bring up the menu of all apps. It is difficult to get the back screen gesture to work. I have to gesture across the screen from right to left two or three times before it responds. The volume is fairly low even at the highest setting. For me, this wasn't a great choice.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Best android mobile phone!!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought the phone from Verizon after my Samsung Note 10+ 5G was crushed by a milwaukee rover battery operated light fell on the screen. I did not buy it from Amazon. The google integration in all the apps works amazing well. After taking a photo I can immediately edit it in pixlr or PSX. As for most of the complaints that most websites have: As for the lack of water resistance. I have taken it on job sitesbthia week and it seems that the absolute need for water resistance of IP68 seems to be overrated. Most people have their phone in their hands or pockets most of the time. No one is really going to wash their phone anymore. I have done this before but it has been years since this event has happened The 60 hz screen: I am not a gamer. The videos look good on the OLED screen and it is generally very responsive when streaming videos. No expandable memory: I am not a ""power user"" and generally satisfied with uploading everything to the cloud. The retrieval process is good on WiFi and on the cellular network to the point where I do not miss storing everything on the device. No wireless charging: I have never had a great experience with wireless charging and generally use the cable anyway. For a $350 phone it has tremendously exceed my expectations. I came from a life with a Samsung note 10+ 5g and the lack of bloat ware, excellent camera software, combined with the google integration with the pixel phones I am hesitant to go back to any other android experience.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I had an iPhone 10s. It started acting up and a reset didn't fix it. I couldn't justify spending that kind of money again so I bought this phone. I cannot believe what a great phone this is.

"I cant pretend like my situation is common. I've been using Galaxy phones since 2015, and even though they've made leaps and bounds in already outstanding quality, I've always been curious about Pixel phones. I figured this phone was cheap enough to be of less consequence if I ended up hating it. Which I don't! I do miss some galaxy features, but this review isn't a place for that. If you're curious about this phone, go watch the youtube reviews. They tell you everything you need to know, and from there you can confidently decide if this phone suits your needs. I love it. Special shout-out to the rear fingerprint scanner. It never fails and it's very responsive.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Picked one of these up after T-Mobile upgraded their network and forced me to upgrade from my beloved Nexus 5. the plastic construction doesnt bother me, since it lives in a thick case. Overall size is on par with the Nexus 5, but with a way larger screen. Sound is decent, battery life is like 3 days of occasional youtube videos, setting up apps and a lot of standby. The camera is outstanding, the headphone jack is a nice to have and the overall construction is spot on. Great for a one handed sized smartphone. Biggest complaints are the lack of wireless charging and how annoying it's going to be to dismantle if i need to replace the battery in a few years, but as a replacement to my 7 year old workhorse, it's looking pretty good.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Google customer service is terrible, took over a month to get it repaired and required me to mail it to them and pay $80. After ai bought a case from them and the screen still cracked, no help from Google and now I'm out another $100. This is after I had two pixel 2's that both had wifi problems. Phone is just not reliable enough to use. DONT BUY, it WILL BREAK.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

The S10e has been my all time favorite and the 4a might end up taking the top spot. Positives for me: *Price: $350 for a phone that meets or beats phones costing over twice as much. The 4a is a steal at this price! *Polycarbonate build with matte finish. Whomever thought putting glass on the back of a phone was a good idea must have a sedentary life style. What a dumb idea. ""Oh, but glass feels preeemium"". Give me a FB. *Light weight: I spend most of the warm months in shorts and I hate having a heavy phone weighing my pocket down. *Beautiful 1080p screen with smooth & fast scrolling, but wish it was 6.0"" to 6.2"". People go on and on about QHD displays and 120Hz which is great, but these are cell phones people not TV screens. I don't care what make phone you have, if you keep your screen on the highest resolution and set to 120Hz your battery will drain at a rapid pace. Add in 5G and you better have a desk job with a plug near by. Cell phone battery technology is not ready for these options and I know because I have had several phones with all three options and they take a lot of juice. *Rear finger print sensor: IMO this is the best way to unlock a phone and the perfect location and the speed of it is perfect. Actually I like the side mounted FP sensor on the S10e a little better and I don't understand why all manufacturers don't use it or a rear mount. *Battery life is excellent and it charges fast enough. These 40w+ chargers some phones use will dramatically shorten battery life, but they do give you the all important bragging rights. I have had over 8 hours SOT on my 4a with brightness set to auto. *128gb of storage is great and should be more than enough for 90% of the users. 6gb of ram is perfect and makes this phone as quick as phones costing twice as much and more. *Headphone Jack: I haven't used one in over 6 years, but a lot of people do. *Haptics: Pixels have the best haptics and weak rattly haptics can ruin the feel of a phone, but not this one. *Stereo Speakers: They sound very good and sound amazing for the price. Plenty loud. Negatives: None, other than a slightly larger screen would have been nice, but is by no means a deal breaker.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Not sure if the glass is gorilla glass. I owned a moto and worked fine after a lots of time of dropping, but just 3 days and it broke. The display is fully gone with no physical damage on screen. It happened even with a protector on,",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Honestly I love this phone. It's quite the step up from the Galaxy j7 I had before. The fingerprint scanner is so good, i've never had issues with it being able to read my fingerprint. The next thing I love about this phone is the camera. The camera is amazing. It's able to zoom in really nicely and even has a night time mode where it is able to capture more light which makes dark pictures much more vibrant. The screen is very scratch resistant as well and even tho the phone is made out of plastic, i havent had any issues with body damage even tho i have dropped it once or twice. But that's probably bcuz I keep it in a case. The only thing that I was a bit disappointed by was the battery life which is not as good as my last phone and runs down quickly when I have the brightness up too high. But I havent had a super big issue with running out of battery life before the end of the day. I think this phone is a really good deal for its price point. totally worth it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Excelente telefono todo en perfectas condiciones,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pros: Well balanced hardware, its snappy and responsive. 6GB of ram have been paired with a processor that can use them. Has a good camera, though I really should snap more pictures and videos with it. front facing camera is great for video calls. Of all of the phones that I have used this is the best in that category. Cons: the UI has a learning curve to it. so take the tutorial. Though this is a new feature with the current Android OS, there is no back button. Yeah I know. I miss it too. there is no slot for a micro SD card. Not a problem if you use the cloud to back them up, but I don't always go were I have a data connection, plus I like to move my videos between devices. And the front facing camera feels off. I personally like the centered punch out cameras on the LG and Samsung phones that I have used. Overall. this is a good value. Even with the arrival of 5G network on the horizon. I recommend this as it fits in the palm of my hand. Has a well matched processor and ram configuration and has 128GB of storage. which should be enough for most users. the front facing camera works really well on video calls even in low light. And the WiFi radio has a good to great range, depending on frequency used.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Este es mi primer dispositivo Pixel (Anteriormente usaba un Moto G) y me ha gustado bastante, extraño un poco los gestos de la gama Moto G para algunas acciones pero en general no hay punto de comparación, todo muy bien.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Though I've only had this Pixel 4a a few days, it has been great so far. The phone came roughly 60% charged and, as far as I can see, didn't require any security updates right away. I was able to open the box and start set-up right away without waiting for charging. The instructions for set-up were good. The box has the cord thingy so you can easily transfer everything from your old Pixel phone to the new one in about 15 minutes or less. It also included a little tool thingy to help get the SIM card out. This was a nice and unexpected bonus that saved a lot of grief. The transfer of everything from the old Pixel to the 4a was smooth and didn’t take a ton of time; the most frustrating part is having to remember your google password, and any other passwords for apps you had on the previous phone. Also some settings needed to be readjusted. As of now, I don't seem to have lost anything, though 8 of my contacts transferred without the names. To clarify: the numbers were there in recent texts without a name attached to them but I was able to read the previous texts and determine whose number it was so I could add them as a new contact by using the 3 little vertical dot thingys on each text. I loved my flagship Pixel but knew I needed a new one because the old one wasn't being supported anymore and performance was getting slower. I chose the Pixel 4a largely due to the fact that the Pixels don't have all the bloatware that comes with Samsung and other brands. I don't use FB or Twitter or a lot of those other apps that take up space and not having these unneeded apps on my phone was a huge deal for me. I like having it be our choice whether to put an app on my phone rather than having these forced on us. I also like the Google Keep for notes and the Google Calendar since I had these on previous phones and everything transferred to this Pixel 4a smoothly. Another good factor is the price of the 4a (this was significant in our decision), particularly because it seems to have everything I need and not a bunch of stuff I don't need or want. An additional plus is the larger screen (no bezel) while still keeping the small size of the phone. The screen looks classy and it's small enough to not be a problem getting in and out of a pocket or purse. Everything is faster and smoother than the old Pixel. The plastic hardware isn't a big deal to me because I use a solid wallet-case for my phones so protection is provided & people don't see the outside of the phone anyway. There are a few nice, new 'bells and whistles' to learn if you are going from an older Pixel but they are good things and nothing to cause great frustration so far. I'm still struggling a little with the gesture thingy - and how to double-tap to get recently used apps to come up so we can close them all out. I liked the way we did it on the old Pixel better - but I am adjusting. I’m also noticing that the new camera seems to be saving 2 of every cameral shot (supposedly one is for editing) and this is annoying because they take up extra space and we rarely edit our photos, so we have to delete the duplicate almost every time. I sure hope Google photos fixes this issue soon. I’m hoping this review might help others who are considering an upgrade to the Pixel 4a. Overall, the upgrade from the flagship Pixel (or Pixel One, or whatever they call it now) appears to have been a good move.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I replaced a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge with this phone. So far, it's been a great phone. I decided the high-dollar flagship phones just aren't worth the cost for me. I don't use most of the features. I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition. I simply want a phone that doesn't lag. The camera is great. Battery life is better than I expected. I don't think I'll fill the 128gb of storage. I hold on to my electronics for as long as I can, so if this will last me more than two or three years, then I'll consider whatever Google has at that time.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"OK so i am coming from a Nexus 5X which had started to creak and so i needed a new phone and was really happy to see all the positive reviews for Pixel 4a& the fact that it is small was a major plus for me , i just got and it and in many ways it is great , the plastic actually feels premium and the screen is great . But as soon as i held it in my hand it felt a little odd ,my Nexus has a flat back and flat cut sides, this is more rounded on the edges and doesn't quite sit in the hand the back is slippery too and feels it will slip out of my hand any moment ..the aspect ratio is a bit odd too and feels narrow, with the aspect ratio the video has to be cut from sides to adjust and the beautiful screen is wasted with two wide dark bands on the side .My Nexus feels light & grippy and sits really well in my hand ...maybe i will get used to it but i wish they had kept the aspect ratio and flat sides",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I had the Pixel 4a for a month in late 2020, and I generally liked the phone. The most important part that makes this phone great is the price, $350. It's not going to get you any top-tier iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but it gives you everything the general user would possibly need - a decently fast Snapdragon 730G SOC, 6GB RAM, and 128GB storage. That's something that not even the $830 base configuration of iPhone 12 gets you. Of course, being $350 there are a few things that it misses out on compared to higher-tier phones. One of those things would be the plastic unibody build over something like a metal and glass sandwich. On a phone of this price point it's fine, though I did have a bit of plastic creaking near the SIM slot. It was just an annoyance at worst, because the rest of the plastic build felt fine. Wireless charging is also not present, this may disappoint some that used it but it didn't bother me cause I never used wireless charging on my iPhone 8. There's no water resistance either, which did raise my eyebrows a bit before I bought the phone but I don't submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty places. One thing this does have that the $700 Pixel 5 doesn't have is a headphone jack. So if you still use anything with a 3.5mm plug, this phone has you covered with no need for adapters! The speakers are also quite good, with one speaker on the bottom next to the USB-C port and one built into the earpiece. As for the software, it's got three years of updates which is better than many Android manufactures, but it still won't top Apple's software support. I did notice a few software bugs when I used it, mainly with YouTube Vanced's PIP mode after a certain amount of time. Restarting fixed the issue but it was an annoyance. Hopefully that was just Android 11 and that gets fixed with a future update. Battery life is also pretty decent, better than the aging battery on my iPhone 8 since I could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night. Given that it's a small phone by today's standards it's not going to be a battery life king, but it's better than the $400 iPhone SE. The size is something I loved about this phone, my hands are relatively small and I like my phone to be pocketable, which is something that I'm not a fan of with most new phones being over 6 inches in size. The 5.81-inch edge-to-edge screen Is of a similar size to my iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, thus I could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pockets. This is something I'm sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phones. The camera has been the definition of the Pixel phones since the first ones launched in 2016. This phone has an amazing single 12MP lens, mostly made great by Google's computational photography software. Night mode was very nice to use, as in the scenarios I used it in it helped out take better photos at night. I'm no expert with cameras so I don't know much about white balance, dynamic range, etc. I do like how this phone gives you one great camera as opposed to other manufacturers which give you like seven different pretty-much-useless camera sensors. Overall, this is the phone to buy if you're on a budget of less than $500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general needs. I would suggest going for the Pixel 4a 5G version if you can afford a $500 phone as that has a second ultrawide camera lens, a faster Snapdragon 765G SOC, and as the name says, 5G connectivity. That phone will overall will give you a very very close experience to the Pixel 5, but if you don't have that much to put down for a phone, and if you like the standard 4a's smaller size, this phone is the way to go. I highly recommend it and I would personally pick this any day of the week over a similarly priced phone from a China brand like Oppo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Vivo, etc.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Pros: Photo quality better than most phone and even DC. Phone size is perfect. Processor is not top grade, but snappy in general usage.

"I typically buy a ""flagship"" phone every 3-4 years until the battery craps out. My last HTC10 went through 3 batteries before I finally cracked the screen and had to buy a new phone. I had been eyeballing the pixels for a while because they don't have all the carrier bloat and pre-loaded apps. I was pleasantly surprised to find this had just android with no third party apps burned into the rom. The setup was easy and pulled data from my old phone as well as all the updated versions of the apps from my old phone Battery life is just crazy. The phone came with about 60% charge. The included fast charger topped it off pretty fast. I wanted to condition the battery by running it way down before recharging a few times. I was kinda shocked that it took almost 3 days to get the phone down to <30% with my typical usage. Adaptive battery is on by default, and I typically have about 3 hours of screen time per day, and it hasn't had me searching for a charger once. This phone was advertised as having an all day battery and I'm sure it is true for heavy users. But for those that aren't on social media all day, this thing will be running for at least 2 days before you have to charge it. The battery life is just awesome. Also, in the first week my phone took 1 major and 2 minor updates which was nice. All my previous carrier phones would get at most 2 updates over their lives. This one gets them as soon as they are released.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
THE PHONE IS HORRIBLE TO USE AND FEATURES DO NOT ALWAYS OPERATE. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAP ON THE SPOT MANY TIMES TO GET IT TO REACT. WHEN TYPING A TEXT IT MOVES OFF SITE MANY TIMES DURING TYPING AND YOU HAVE TO GO ON A SEARCH FOR IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT RELENTLESSLY PUSHES GOOGLE CONTENT. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST PURCHASING THIS PHONE. IT IS REALLY NOT A GOOD PRODUCT AND I AM IMMEDIATELY LOOKING FOR ANOTHER PHONE AND HOPEFULLY RETURN THIS ONE.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

This phone is perfect!! I love it and am actually writing this review on it right now.

You won't regret buying this phone!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It was not clear that a purchase of SIM card was essential to make the phone work. So have ordered one. Also the fingerprint ID took many attempts to register. I am still excited to try this out. Music sound was great. I am hoping to see the missed messages once the card is installed. Not an IT tech savy grandma - directions could have told me to insert card from the beginning and that would have been very helpful.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I don't want either of those things on my phone and there is no way to remove them without installing a different build.

"Fantastic software and camera, Google really made something here. For the price, there aren’t many that can compare. One big issue though, the plastic body does expand/bend due to heat. Don’t believe me? If you have a Pixel 4a or can get your hands on one at a retailer, place it flat down (screen down) and see how it wobbles a bit. Need further verification? Look at the screen from the bottom up horizontally, you’ll see some devices are slightly twisted. Google made a mistake with the plastic encasing. To add, why produce three phones the same year?

"I purchased my Pixel 4a for a couple of reasons. My iPhone 7 Plus was getting a little long in the tooth and I'd been considering an upgrade but even as an iPhone user since the original one, I'd become a bit turned off by ever increasing pricing on Apple's phones. Also, as a product of the Walkman generation I really missed having a headphone jack. Fast forward four months and I'm using an iPhone 12 Pro Max.. what went wrong? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The Pixel 4a is a really great phone. Nice form factor, always on display, fast and responsive fingerprint reader, a headphone jack and frequent updates to its operating system. My only real misgiving is the lack of wireless charging, which is quickly becoming essential to me. This is a great phone that you can customize to your heart's content, and if you're not entrenched in Apple's ecosystem you can probably go ahead and purchase without any reservations. I say 'probably', because I felt very ready to pick up and move away from Apple's ecosystem, however your circle of friend, family and co-workers should be taken into account. What do the people in your life use? If it's primarily iPhone, that may provide some friction to your transition over to Android. In my case I found that not being connected to iMessage and Facetime was enough of an inconvenience that I was using my iPod Touch to replace the features I no longer had access to on my phone. Silly, right? That was my conclusion, and I went ahead and bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max. Do I LIKE one more than the other? I suppose the iPhone 12 does feel a bit more premium, due largely to the fact that it is... I don't think it's a question of 'like', though. Your phone is more a question of fit for your life, and as positively as I felt about the Pixel 4a, the fit wasn't quite right. Things may be different for you, but I can stand behind the Pixel 4a as a quality phone and a bargain at its list price.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone, good battery life, fingerprint works very well unlike other phones, camera quality is great and the phone is very easy to activate, just pop any carrier sim card in and you're ready to go",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The worst thing about Pixel Phones is the inability to set independent volume controls for Ringtones and Notifications. At work, I can't have all 50 of my apps dinging all day and disturbing my coworkers, so i have to turn the volume down. Especially during fantasy football season with the espn alert. The problem is I miss all my phone calls now that are important. It's extremely annoying and thousands of people have complained about this simple feature. I will never buy another pixel phone until this is fixed. **** Not to mention, turning the volume all the way down using the rocker, and then turning the volume all the way up, leaves the ringtone and notification volume at 20%, and only raises the media volume. WTF??? You have to go deep into the settings to manually bring the volume back. I miss so many important calls!!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have only had this phone for a few days and it is pretty good so far. The only problem I have that stands out is the battery life for this phone is terrible.

The finger print scanner is very good and a nice addition for a 350$ phone along with 128 gigs of storage. The smoothness and speed of the phone is also very good.

The odd no button-button takes some getting used to. Even after several months it might take an extra try or two to get it to do what I want.

"Not a huge leap from a Pixel to a Pixel 4a. That's how I like it. This is my first new phone in many years. I had been buying used off of ""that other site"" as I didn't like buying from the carriers. You get so much crap on the phone when you buy from them, and they're not any cheaper. This was actually about $30 cheaper than brand ""V"". This is fast, the battery life is great, and it functions so much like my last one that there's almost no learning curve. I don't care about a lot of fancy things, or super duper camera and all that. If I want to take serious photos, I have a DSLR for that.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"While I love the latest Android OS and how responsive this phone is, as well as its great battery life, the phone has one fatal flaw that you need to be aware of. The phone is extremely sensitive to the presence of moisture, and for many of us, it has died in circumstances that any other phone would do just fine in. Mine died when I had it in the pocket of my waterproof ski pants for 2.5 hours on the ski slope, on a rainy day. The pocket was zipped closed the entire time, and I didn't remove the phone from the pocket until I was in my car. The pocket was not wet inside, even the tissue in the pocket was dry. However my phone's display, when turned on, lit up, but was unresponsive to touch. A day later the same. I can see a very slight haze of humidity on the inside of the selfie lens. I suspect the high humidity in the pocket was enough to short out the screen. Buyer beware - I recommend you Google the issue before purchasing.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"So I’ve been waiting a while for a new phone that has just the right amount of features that don’t break the bank. All the things that I was looking for in a phone, the Pixel 4a has them: - At least 6GB of RAM. Check! - Snapdragon 7XX or better. Check! - Good camera. Check! - Android updates. Check! - Headphone jack. Check! - Stereo speakers. Check! - 64GB of UFS 2.1 storage or better. Check! The features that Google spared on the Pixel 4a, I don’t think are essential and only serve to drive the price up, this include: - Wireless charging. - Waterproof certification. - Multi-camera setup. - High refresh display. - 5G Network. Here are some phones I was considering: OnePlus Nord For a moment I was thinking about it, as it comes with the more recent Snapdragon 765 SOC, 90Hz refresh display, but the fact that it didn’t come with stereo speakers, headphone jack, gimmicky quad camera setup and it’s not available in the US was a turn off. Samsung / Moto I was considering also the Samsung Galaxy A71, but I don’t appreciate that it comes loaded with bloatware. Another good contender was the Motorola One Fusion+, but I didn’t want to deal with any issues with the pop-up selfie camera. All other Chinese brands were out of the equation, as I don’t like their OS UIs, as I prefer the closer to stock Android experience. The Pixel 4a has a very good balance of features in a compact size. PROS - Clean bloatware free software. - 3 years of mayor Android OS updates. - Killer camera with night and astrophotography modes. - Good performance with 6GB of RAM. - Plenty of storage with 128GB. CONS - Battery size: I hope the 3140mAh battery is enough for the needs of tomorrow (I’m upgrading from a similar 3000mAh phone that has degraded to 2784mAh after three years of use). - Snapdragon 730: I can’t help to think that the SD765 would be better future-proof, but the 730 will be more than enough if you don't game. - No microSD slot to expand storage. I think google has hit a home-run with this one, if you can live with those caveats, just get it! However if you think you could do a little better, wait a little longer for the Pixel 4a 5G (revealed on late September / early October), as rumors say it will come with Snapdragon 765, a bigger battery, dual back lens, and 5G for $150 more.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
1 drop no cracked screen and had a case on it no SIM card will read anymore at all I’ve only had this phone not even a month and it already is screwed up in some way don’t buy Amazon refurbished phones as main phones. It’s just a rip off,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I like this phone a lot but not as much as my Android phones in the past. The pro is the Google integration. I was able to easily move all my Google app information over to the new phone. The con is some glitches and updates. It glitches on certain non-Google apps, though that seems to have been fixed after a while. I did an update yesterday and some things stopped working the way they did before which is annoying. The weirdest thing is sometimes Google Chrome will stop working on my phone. I have no idea why. However I have discovered that if I just turn my phone off and turn it back on that usually fixes it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Ya'll HAVE to be getting paid to write these good reviews because this phone is the worst, most awful ""smart"" phone around. I didn’t purchase this phone from amazon, I actually got it from my carrier (Verizon) but am writing a review on here because if you’re like me you read amazon reviews before purchasing things even if not from amazon themselves. I don’t even know where to start. This phone has been complete C R A P from the beginning. The first week I had it, it glitched out so hard IT DELETED EVERYTHING I HAD BACKED UP when it automatically tried to update from android 10 to 11. Wow, thanks a lot. Thank goodness I had auto sync from my previous pixel 2 turned on and it had about 90% of my items saved but still, the 10% (oh yeah that was ALL OF MY TEXT MESSAGES with scheduling dates, phone numbers and addresses that I needed to get in touch with clients at a later date) wasn't recoverable at all. Really made me look unprofessional having to get back in touch with all of my clients, asking them to resend me the information they had previously sent. Also that didn’t include the people I couldn’t remember so… I had some missed appointments WHICH COST ME TIME AND MONEY, really really awesome, great job google. Now I paid for this terrible piece of technology in addition to missed appointments fees, GLAD THATS WHAT MY SAVINGS IS GOING TO, THANKS SO SO MUCH. NOW I CANT AFFORD TO EVEN GET A PHONE THAT CAN ACTUALLY DO WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO DO. Moving on. We called verizion, they couldn’t figure it out so they sent me an entirely new phone. I figured its a 4”a” maybe there are still some bugs; technology isn’t perfect, stuff happens, whatever, I’ll try this again with a new phone I guess. Really don’t have any other options considering I had just spent my money on late/missed appointments and this awful phone. JOKE WAS ON ME, the second phone was JUST as bad. My boyfriend is pretty tech savvy and did some research and found that other users on a reddit forum were having similar problems and that it was an error with the new android 11 operating system, so when we got my new 4a, we didn’t update the software and kept it on the 10 operating system. Was okay for a while but after about a week the screen started freezing up, locking the screen on whatever I was doing. None of there buttons would work so I just held down the power button until it eventually turned off. I don’t use my phone for much, just simple communication and basic social media. I don’t have any games, editing apps or anything crazy, literally just social media apps/email and you cut video editor. My phone has never been exposed to any crazy elements, I’ve never dropped it, it’s never gotten wet, too hot or too cold; I take exceptional care of my electronics because I’m not trying to pay the ludicrous amount they charge for phones these days more than I have to. I take photos and text people on it, thats literally it. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. We updated the system after a week or so because leaving it on 10 was just not working. As soon as we updated it to 11, what do you know?! ISSUES EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME!!!! I really don’t understand it at all. I’m super super super super disappointed I bought this POS. Should have gone with a “whole” pixel, not some stupid “a” version. Every. Single. Time. I want to use my bluetooth, it NEVER remembers any devices, except for my car somehow? If I want to connect it to one of the google speakers we have, or stream anything, I have to completely forget the device entirely that I’m trying to connect to, EVEN THOUGH IVE CONNECTED TO IT 20+ TIMES, restart my phone, turn the bluetooth on, “search for a new device” go through all of those motions, then it works. EVERY TIME I want to use the bluetooth, this is the ONLY way it will work. It freezes up and I have to restart it just about every single day. It constantly disconnects from my headphones so I can’t use it to listen to music…. I got new Sony earbuds as a gift which are really amazing but I can’t really use them since I have to go through the described process above to connect to even be able to use them, then, it usually disconnects from the headphones after about 20 minutes, for no reason. I feel so silly getting so upset over something like this but I’m not exactly wealthy and don’t have time or money to waste on stupid crap this “smart” phone is doing that literally any other phone could do. I am die hard google supporter, apple isn’t my jam but I am considering switching after this phone, this is such a load of baloney, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME MONEY OR ENERGY ON THIS USELESS PHONE, buy a full pixel or don’t get any version of it al all. I’m 1000000000000000000% disappointed that google would release such terrible product, I hate this phone, I really do. I wish I could afford to get a full pixel but I guess I’ll just have to wait. I would rate this product negative -10 stars if possible, this is such a sham/joke DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is a premium phone at a mid-level price. Great camera, fast processer, decent battery life, a sharp screen and no bloatware. The finger print sensor also works well. It is a small phone which I like but others may prefer a larger screen. If you can live without 5G this is a hard phone to beat.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"awesome, 128GB is amazing.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"had the 3a XL before this phone, transferred everything over and its the same great feel. Very minimalistic and does everything you need it to. Its overall a bit smaller than the 3a XL which can be annoying if you have larger hands. If you have a perfectly working 3a though I wouldn't recommend upgrading, or maybe upgrading to a 5 if you really want to. 4a is a great phone for 350, makes me not want to go back to $1000 phones ever again. Tagged along with google fi google photos, google web messaging, it offers a great user experience.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Just got it today, put the sim in and was ready to go has a great OLED display and love the Google features. It's a 350 dollar phone obviously it's going to missing some features that a higher end phone would have.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Screen is nice. Nice size. Not bloated. Battery easily lasts over a day for my casual use. I turn it off at night. Nice to get the OS updates before other Android cellphone mfgs. You can't remove the Google search bar at the bottom of the home screen so I installed Evie. Reception is average (better would be nice). It has the headphone jack but the sound quality is like, why bother, compared my LG V20. I'd much rather have a micro SD slot than mediocre audio and use a USB dongle. But then I'd probably want a bigger battery and complain about the size/weight.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I chose this phone for it's excellent camera reviews. However, it's drawbacks for me are: 1. No micro sd card slot, so I couldn't transfer my music (saved to sd) over easily 2. Short battery life- if it's used heavily during the day, it doesn't last the whole day. I'd probably go for something else, if I could go again.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I was sure that Amazon Warehouse goods are tested and works fine but it's not. I sure nobody even turn it on. Camera is one of the most significant part of device doesn't work at all. No fix for this. Sure you can send it back to Amazon and maybe they will sell it again. Why not? I live in central Europe, so i used reshipper to get this phone. Spent about 70$ for get it here + local taxes. Will spend another 20$ for delivery to US. Almost 100$ loss because someone didn't do his work.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I like the phone so far. Only been using for a week. Very easy to transfer apps and data from older phone. Had no trouble setting up with Visible. Battery life pretty good. Perfect size phone for my liking.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone! I take a lot of photos... Many of my photos are taken in the city, often while the passenger in a moving vehicle. This smaller profile Pixel is perfect! As well as having TONS of memory...the camera is fantastic. I 'downsized' from the Pixel 4XL... this is JUST as fantastic, but much more manageable while in motion. All the features you need, without all the extra stuff you will never use anyway. I have had the phone several days, and only charged it twice... Even though the phone has a smaller profile, the screen is not small...Same brilliant phone, just a bit smaller. You will love it!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The only disappointment is the display. It has a yellow tint compare to IPS. In any other aspects it is a great phone with a great camera and good battery life.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Wow, just wow. I've been using this all day now and I love this little phone. I'm using two phones now, as this will be used for a lot of the useful Google tools- like, screening calls (which I just did), using my phone through commands only (watch YouTube videos on how to do this), and that awesome camera. I've taken both video and still and am quite amazed like everyone else seems to say. Anyway, definitely one of the best phones you can buy at any price IMO. Plus, don't worry about the processor speed- I'm having zero issues with how fast it runs apps. Good luck to ya.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"First impressions, the phone isn't blowing my mind. I've been using it for a month+ and I'd say overall it is underwhelming for the price. Camera is pretty nice, however the plastic between the power button and the camera will flex and squeaks when you press around it. Screen scratched very easily. Battery life is pretty unremarkable, I get about a day of use with it. Screen is actually smaller than my last phone. Speakers are also pretty average, didn't impress me at all. My Motorola sounded way better. I had to get a new phone since my carrier didn't want to support VOLTE on that model. Decided I'd go with this since it's affordable for a Pixel. It'll do for a couple years I guess.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I moved from a Note 8 to the Pixel 4a and it was mostly a pleasant experience but in the end I switched back. I was initially concerned with how much smaller this phone is compared to my Note but the smaller size started to grow on me. It's easy to hold and you can reach all the buttons one handed. The material and weight of the phone does make it feel ""cheaper"" but it material did have a nice feel to it and the buttons are VERY clicky. The battery life on this phone was AMAZING! I got close to 34 hours from a full charge. This was a drastic improvement over my Note which barely makes it through half the day now. The camera was pretty decent but I must admit I did not take very many photos. I think I prefer the camera from my Note over this one. My favorite part about the Pixel 4a is actually the Android 11 experience. The Pixel software features are well thought out and really improved my daily interactions. The automatic call screening is a huge relief from the frequent sales and spam calls I would receive throughout the day. The phone would try to suggest a set time for bed to gain better sleep and auto dim, change the color temperature, and adjust the notification settings. The software with the phone feels really polished and it was a wonderful experience to use. Now for the cons... One of my biggest issues is Google did not provide an IPX rating for this phone. Yes it is a cheap phone but I do not want to accidentally cause water damage from using it in rain, because we don't know its rating! Other negatives in my opinion are - no face unlock/ID, not IRIS unlock, the fingerprint scanner works well but not perfect especially if it gets the slightest bit dirty. Also, I have gotten pretty spoiled with wireless charging so the Pixel 4a not having that feature was a huge let down. This is an awesome phone for what it does at this price point, but I'm switching back to my Note 8 and eagerly awaiting the Pixel 5 release.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Bad choice. I don't like this phone. I've had it 3 months and I wish I could go back to my Samsung, it locks up. a lot. i miss the home and back buttons and I dont feel it's very user friendly. I would not buy any other google phone. LG and Samsung phones have been better than this phone... live n learn.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Can't really go wrong with this phone. I dont like it as much as the 3a though, because the gestures they added are actually annoying and dont work half the time.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This phone is good as a backup phone. No more than that. Nothing surprising. People could have more and better choices.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This not going be a technical review for this phone. Rather it's just my impressions about owning it. This phone is fantastic. I get two and a half days out of the battery but I also don't live on my phone. One of the great things is no bloatware, what a nice change. This phone basically set itself up, a bit of a letdown for someone who enjoys ""tinkering"" with things. I do like the fingerprint reader. If it will work on my fingers, it should work for anyone. Great camera, a first for me, settings I expect to find on my SLR not a phone. I really haven't got to try it but I will try to report what I think later on. I would DEFINITELY recommend a case but then I am a big believer in cases. Overall I would recommend this phone to anyone. Edit 02/13/21 So it's been a little over a month and my feelings about this phone haven't changed. The camera is fantastic. I'm still not going to get rid of the Nikon. It's nice for those moments when you say ""I wish I had a camera"". It seems I find a new feature every day. I would still recommend this to anyone who feels a 1000+ is a bit much for a phone",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Bought this directly from Google, not off Amazon. I'll try to keep this concise. NOTE: I've owned the Pixel 2, Pixel 3, and now the 4a. This is the last Google device I plan on owning until their finished product becomes more reliable. Every single device I've owned from Google has had some kind of different issue: the 2's camera stopped working; the 3's battery started draining inexplicable and dramatically; and now - the 4a - randomly reboots without any prompting from the user. The solution? get a replacement from Google...the problem - those replacements have the same issues. Google should get out of hardware, until they're ready to be more reliable when it comes to their finished products. If you're dropping hundreds of dollars on a smartphone in 2020, it is reasonable to expect it to work. WHEN this phone works, it's a solid phone with a great camera and solid battery life...IF it was dependable, it'd be a good value. But, like all of their handsets to date, know that you're taking a risk when you purchase one (if you don't get a dud, you'll be happy with this).",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I've had my phone for a couple of months and over the past few weeks it keeps having to reset itself. It will probably have to go back to fix this. The battery doesn't last very long.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I bought this and totally didn't realize the camera was IN THE SCREEN. Actually really annoying, especially when I am reading an online comic or something. But other than that REALLY ANNOYING FEATURE, it's a great phone. I've noticed it is hard to find custom cases for it, a lot of people seem to skip the 4a. :(",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone. I hated the way you control the phone but after messing with it I was able to change it to have the 3 controls at the bottom and now it's better. The huge camera. Makes 25% of the screen go black with most games so you have a even smaller screen the battery isn't that great either,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"After just one week, I tried to swipe up to get my apps and nothing happened. It would only boot into safe mode. I called up the tech support and they guided me through a factory reset. It still didn't solve the problem. The tech rep said we did everything and something was wrong with the phone. Garbage.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was very excited about this phone. I read multiple glowing reviews. Phone arrived yesterday and I've spent several hours with it. I am coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy S8. There's nothing really wrong with that phone. It's just not getting updates anymore and I liked the thought of a pure Android phone. The S8 had some quirks such as a big delay in being able to take a picture while Google Maps was active (bad for road trips). Here are some thoughts/findings about the 4a vs the S8: 1. On the 4a I find it a bit frustrating to not being able to close apps as easily as on the S8 2. The S8 camera has more options - including a pro mode. I think it still takes marginally better pictures than the 4a 3. The Gboard has a space and down button at the bottom which is impossible to remove. Gboard on S8 does not have this 4. I find it very easy to hit the back button gesture by mistake on the the 4a and then have to open the app again 5. I immediately installed a case and screen protector on the 4a, but it still feels like I could easily drop it 6. The battery life isn't that great on the 4a - about the same as the 3 year old S8 I'd say 7. Stereo speakers on the 4a is nice - but you have to hold it about a foot away from your face to get the effect 8. 128 GB of included storage on the 4a is nice (vs 64 GB on the S8), but I also have a 200 GB SDCard in the S8 9. 4a gets hot! It has complained about not being able to do a few things (transcribe for example) because it was too hot Jury is still out if it will replace the S8 or not. And if it does replace it, what happens to the old phone? It's only worth $100 or less. I'd say if you were looking for a great phone for the money, and it's better that what you currently have, definitely get the 4a as it's a good price and has a lot of great features. However, carefully compare it against what you currently have as it might not really be that much better.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
As soon as i powered it on it asked me to update software and restart. So i did and it never booted back on. Returning it right now,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Good quality photo. Night mode is excellent.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I bought the Pixel 4A (Not the 4A 5G) to replace a older HTC model which is no longer being updated. Before buying it I looked at other phones and found that most didn't get regular OS or Security updates or if they did it was months after the update became available which makes me nervous. When looking at a lot of the other phones I found that most came with built in apps that quite frankly I would never use and more often than not you couldn't un install which I don't like one bit. The Pixel 4A came with a lot of google apps (Most of which can be uninstalled which is a breath of fresh air) and the apps that can't be uninstalled like Google assistant (Which is part of the OS) can be completely turned off unlike some other assistant apps from other companies which really helps preserve my privacy. I am extremely pleased and pleasantly surprised with the ability to turn things off or uninstall the apps I don't want. Unlike many people I don't use my phone a lot so I only have to charge it twice a week so batterie life is great! The phone has worked perfectly since I got it and Over all I am extremely pleased with the purchase!! I would definitely reccomend this phone to anyone!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was extremely torn between this phone and the Moto G Power (2020 version). They are both great phones without bloatware, and top of their relative classes, but I'm very happy I paid more for the Pixel 4a. It's smaller, lighter, way better camera, better hardware, more software/security updates, and I prefer Google apps anyway. It has more features than I'll use, but not a ridiculous amount like on the Samsung Galaxy S4 I had years ago. I was nervous about battery life, just because I'm used to having a phone with a ridiculous battery, but there are so many settings that extend your battery life on this phone. There's a battery saver mode AND an extreme battery saver mode! I want this phone to last as many years as possible, so I use the extreme mode all the time time. I don't have to charge it but once every 1-3 days. If I used the phone more I would probably have to charge it once a day. I like I can unpause specific apps, while leaving the rest in battery save mode. I was nervous about buying a used (not renewed) phone on Amazon, especially because the one I purchased was only considered in ""good condition, with minor scratches on front, back, and sides"". The phone I received is nearly flawless! I actually didn't notice the incredibly minute scratches on the left side, and bottom right corner of the screen for at least 30 minutes out of the box. They're so small I thought they were dust. There are no marks on the back or sides at all. I couldn't be happier with this phone and I'm so glad I saved some money buying it used. I can't speak for longevity, but my bank gives me a 2yr warranty past a phone's release date, and the Pixel only came out Aug 2020. Seriously get this phone if you like smaller phones, if you need a cheaper phone, I would get the Moto G Power(2020 version only!) in a heartbeat.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is my first pixel and I really want to love it. It seems like a solid phone with all the stuff I need, until the microphone stopped working after 2 weeks. When on the phone, I can only be heard over speaker. After doing some troubleshooting following google instructions, it is determined a microphone issue. Seems like there are some pixel users with microphone problems. I could have brought the phone to an authorized repair shop to have it fixed for free, but I contacted Amazon costumer service first. The representative tried to connect me with a google representative, but was unsuccessful. So it got a replacement. So far the replacement works well.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone came DOA, it wont charge anymore. EDIT: I have read some other reviews and it seems I was not the only one with these energy/battery issues. I charged it the first time and after that would not charge with the stock charger or cable connected to PC, tried many chargers. The phone would randomly shut down even with 20% battery. Already returned the phone",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've had many Pixel phones and the Nexus 5 that came before. My last phone was a Pixel 3XL so I'm used to the top of the line flagship - fast, great camera, great display. But this time I decided to go small and affordable and darn if it wasn't a great decision! I'm really happy with the phone so far. Pros The battery life is WAY better that the Pixel 3XL and I've heard it's much better than the Pixel 4. Nice to have a one handed phone again! The pics I've taken have been very good - can't tell and difference in quality from my Pixel 3 pictures. The screen is sharp and colors bright. It's much, much lighter than the heavy phones I've had in the past. Pixels come with Android updates right away and don't have all that Samsung or other manufacturer junk apps installed. In all my years of Pixel ownership I've never had a lemon, great reliability. And Google Pixel's call screening service ROCKS! Google it. Not pros No wireless charging. If this is something you need give this one a pass. Water resistant but not waterproof. Not 5G. I personally could give two hoots about 5G, my speeds are fast as they are and I sure don't need to pay the mmWave tax for Verizon that makes the Pixel 5 too expensive. Only 1 size, no XL. Plastic back. Mine is hidden by my case so I don't care what it looks like and to me it doesn't feel cheaply made. Slower processor than Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5. Moving up from a Pixel 3 I have noticed no difference so far, even though my old Pixel 3 is faster I can't really tell in normal daily use. If you're a heavy gamer or watch a ton of streaming you might want to get the Pixel 5. Best part, the price for an unlocked Pixel is only $349, such a great deal compared to how much more I paid for the Pixel 3XL only two years ago.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The only downside i've noticed in the few days I've had my phone is the battery. it's not amazing. But for the price, I think this phone is amazing. Also, the fingerprint reader works amazing and it's super fast.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
An amazing compact phone that has the perfect camera Would also recommend getting a skin for it as the case will make it bigger which defeats the purpose,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This device is unlockable - yea!!! However, you will need a type C to USB A cable if you are going to connect the phone to your PC's USB port down the road, so add that to your order (I wish someone would have told me). To unlock this phone: get your finger ready to scroll.... and 1. to get into Developer mode: go to settings - about phone - tap Build number 6 times, your phone may ask you for your pass code at this point, once done 2. Then once you are a Developer go to settings - system - advanced - developer options - then OEM unlocking :) slide the button 'on' and you should be good.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Best phone over ever owned and couldn't imagine what I would get out of spending 3 times as much. I can't justify spending$1200 to get a better waterproof rating or wireless charging. You hardly have to charge the thing to begin with. The fingerprint reader is awesome to replace passwords on my financial apps that I prefer not to have memorized. The camera is awesome and the night sight is a cool feature. The battery lasts almost 2 days and charges to 100% in 90 minutes. There are a ton of technical reviews on the tech websites so I'll end it here,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Coming from a Pixel 2 I had concerns whether the 4a would be at all quicker. Well it is somewhat--I can play games such as Temple Run 2 on higher detail settings with no sluggishness. Overall this phone is nice and quick and everything I need. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the rear fingerprint reader (the lack of which is a big reason why I did not upgrade to the Pixel 4 in 2019). So happy that Google brought it back in 2020. Battery life so far is great, going well over 20 hours before getting to where I feel safer plugging it in. My use is lighter than probably most people, but it's at least as good if not better on battery life then my Pixel 2 under the same usage.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Every worked fine for a day or two and then while talking on speaker the phone will just cut out and neither one can hear the other. the same thing that i'm returning the first one for.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I got this as a Christmas present for a secondary phone to use. I am an apple user and love how my brain can handle that os. I have had the OG Pixel and the 2 back in the day and loved it for the simplicity of use and sleek OS of Android. This phone reminds me of all that stuff that made me love android as a good solid OS without having bloat ware and the lack of future proofing. It’s a beautiful display for 60 hertz, one hand use is really great and the build reminds me of the Nexus 5. The camera was a pressing surprise given that I think it’s the same sensor that was on my 2. The price is really great, I just feel that when you compare Coke to Pepsi, the iPhone SE has a processor that can really run laps around most other phones. That downside is that it can ding battery life. I’m really happy with the 4a that it made me take time out of my day to review. I really think this and the 5 are solid picks. But also, I don’t need 5G just yet because it’s not a big need for me as of now. My ONLY complaint is you can’t get the google extended warranty outside of buying it from the google store. That’s where Apple wins, you can have 60 days to add that right from settings of the devices if you like to keep phones longer than a year. But that’s just me.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Love this phone!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Best budget phone.....it has 2xram of iphone X...good storage(128)...lots of feature...it had some glitch and I noticed the low resolution, which I got used to...but other than those it was great....fast charging(18watts).....and good camera.. can't really complain much for the price.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Doesn't have face recognition. Worked well initially, but screen started flickering and then suddenly started becoming blue in certain screen spots that spread and made it unusable. No water exposure at all.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"If you don't care about all the bells and whistles, this phone is freaking awesome. The fingerprint reader works well and fast. Like many others, it does have issue if your fingers are wet but this is expected. The camera is awesome. Since processor is a tad slow, it takes like 2 seconds to process but it doesn't bother me. If you haven't tried astrophotography it'll amaze you. Even my eyes cannot see things clearly but with just a touch of light this phone can take a picture like it's under afternoon light. For everyday use it's sleek and fast enough, i never have a problem. Coming from ip x I'd say this phone is wonderful!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Camera is great and night vision is impressive. The battery can probably last a day if not gaming on it. It is very light but has the same size as my iPhone X. Overall great value compare to my $1200 iPhone X that I have just retired. The screen is decent but not impressive. I also had a OnePlus 8pro. I used 120HZ refresh rate all the time, but quite honestly I don't see a great difference between them. Honestly, I would really hope this phone to have a bigger screen. The specs could be identical since I don't really need that many gimmicks. At this price, I will definitely recommend this phone to anyone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I had to come revise my review as i'm on my second Google pixel 4a within months. The first one was replaced after it was damaged by the rain while i was running. Google claims this phone to be water resistant but yesterday, nautre put it to test once again, im now sure this phone is simply inaccurately advertised. The pixel is great when it comes to photos, just dont buy one thinking that its water resistant.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I upgraded from a Pixel 2, and it's a smart fiscal move to get a new phone. It seems to work as intended with a day's battery life, and transferring over is super easy and fast. I would give this a 5/5 stars if there wasn't a but to be had. My gripe about the change is that on the home screen when you're choosing your icons they force a date and day at the top to take away 20% of your space. I would have been less enthusiastic, and maybe held off longer on a new phone had I known this was the case. If you don't like the sound of less customization on your home screen maybe now is a time to try a Galaxy Note.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Almost perfect! A giant in a small body. The one of a very few devices are able to read my wife's fingerprints! It makes very good photos, at least in compare with Samsung competitors. Only 1 thing is not very comfy is a missing of apps grouping.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Google has finally been able to make use of their customer feedback to create one of the most practical phones money can buy, at a price that is almost impossible to turn down. Pros: -Beautiful, bright, OLED screen that screams of a value point much much higher that where it currently sits. -Powerful camera features, especially Night Sight from its big brothers, that works fantastically in all sorts of difficult lighting conditions. -Good battery life, easily serviceable for a full day because of the efficient processor. -Great feeling and looking build (not sure what all the hype is about glass backs when plastic feels this good) -Wonderful haptic feedback and full-sounding loudspeaker -Headphone jack is back! -Rear fingerprint sensor that serves as notification pull-down -Wonderful size and form factor. I have large hands and still feel like this footprint is perfect -Very capable and efficient 730G chipset (less than 20% slower than the 765G on Pixel 5) Cons -No wide angle or telephoto lens (personally would have loved to see a 3x 12MP lens perhaps?) -No wireless charging or water resistance (though with a C - to - C cable you'd probably still be able to charge your buds) Overall, this phone get's my highest recommendation. It nails everything you need, and doesn't give you anything you don't. (OnePlus 2MP macro, anyone?) Easily the best budget phone of 2020.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My phone died and I needed a new one fast, so I bought a Pixel 4a based on all the glowing recommendations from friends. Turns out they were talking about the 4a5G, which not only has 5g support, it is a bigger phone with a larger screen. Don't get me wrong, the 4a is a fine device, but the screen is small enough that some modern apps are hard to use.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone worked good for only two weeks, then it would not ring anymore, then I notice that the volume of the phone was very low and I could barley hear the other person talking. This is a big issue for me because I use it for business, so I would miss all my calls and the sound for incoming text was not working either. I tried to fix the issue and I found out from doing my research on the internet that this is a major issue for this phone( Google Pixel 4A). If would of knew that, then I would off not bought this phone. The reason I bought this phone because it was small and compact. But I had to buy another phone that would ring so I could answer my calls for business. I would not recommend this phone to anybody because this seems to be a major issue for this phone. Save your money and bough another phone that will not give you any issues.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Love my new phone. It was so easy to switch everything over.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone for my mom. She likes it a lot!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The is a great budget phone , that you cannot be mad at. The finger print reader is pretty fast and super secure. This is not a under screen finger print sensor so it unlocks you phone instantly. This phone has a surprisingly small battery but I get exceptional usage out of it. I'm up from 4 in the morning and doing my usual ig youtube emails and games I usually have 15 percent @7pm. The best thing about the phone is android 11, I am upgrading from one plus 2 with lollipop and the different in os is huge. But it runs so smooth. Apps open and work flawlessly and everything is very quick and responsive for a 350 dollar phone. The only con for me is the screen size , more specifically the width. It took a bit of adjusting from my oneplus 2 which was wider and easier to type on. I make way more typos with this to the point is use the voice typing now more than touch (which wasn't available on lollipop). Overall I am very pleased with this phone, for the money I can see myself using this until the android updates stop. I love my one plus 2 but even with that small con, I don't see myself not using this phone for a long time.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm glad to have a pure Android experience again with no carrier bloatware and no stupid system modifications from manufacturers like OnePlus. (They are the worst manufacturer in terms of needlessly killing background apps). The camera is fantastic! It's half because of the software and half because of the large pixels in the sensor. It's great in low light. The Night Sight mode is so much fun! On a tripod or some other stable surface, astrophotography mode will engage in Night Sight mode that allows for amazing star photos. The real-time HDR adjustment and preview is really nice. Basically, you tap on some portion of the photo to choose what you want the primary exposure to lock onto (like the bright part of a sunset) then a slider appears that lets you control the fill light. It's wonderful! It got the Android 11 update immediately after I bought it, so that's cool. Lots of nice little updates in that. The default gesture navigation doesn't work well with 3rd party launchers. (I use Nova Launcher). When I swipe up to go to the home screen, I can't tap any icons for 1 second. They don't respond. It's weird. But with the old school 3-button nav it works fine. Swiping up from the bottom also appears to choose the 3rd party launcher and if it were an app, then it reopens it. That might be part of that problem. Neither of these things happen with the default launcher, but that launcher wastes so much space on the clock and the search bar, so I don't like it. The CPU/GPU is plenty fast for me. I don't play much mobile gaming. Just some board games sometimes. The AI in Waterdeep takes it's turns quite a bit faster than on my old OnePlus 3T, so that's nice. Headphone jack and fingerprint reader are a huge plus for me. You get a lot of phone for the price!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Love the phone. It's slim, great battery so far. Very responsive and smooth. Only bad thing in the tiny charging cable. It's 38"" long. Also the charger is USB C out so you'll have to buy a special cable just for it. Ugh.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Very sleek and clean.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm coming from a 2 year old pixel 3xl 128 that was giving be about 7 hours before needing a charge. Because I absolutely need all day battery life (for work), I was hoping this would fit the bill. Yeah, I know I should get the Moto G Power, but it does not have NFC for mobile payments. My results with this phone, some days it does just barely make it to 8 hours after heavy use. One day I needed to plug it in. Most of the time though, it's at 25% after my shift. I think this is a let down because after a year, this phone will be way worse the what the pixel 3xl is now. Also, some of my inventory apps are buggy and crash when using the barcode scanner, whereas the 3 never had a problem. Really no big deal, I'm sure it'll get sorted after a few updates. I gotta say, I haven't had a smallish phone in years, and this one seems great. Has a clicky power button (yeah!!) and an actual headphone jack. F.Y.I I ordered a silicone case for it, but it's hasn't arrived, but I was able to find an iphone x case at the dollar store. Works great.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Honestly, I'm a bit disappointed with this phone, though I really wanted to like it. I made my purchase directly through Google, not Amazon, but I really felt like saying something about the 4a. Every phone has features that you like or dislike and the dislikes with this phone have been a real turn-off. I bought the 4a as a replacement for a ASUS Zenfone 3 Max, which I really loved until the camera started taking mushy photos. In-fact, that's the main reason I replaced the Zenfone, which was otherwise functioning flawlessly. For about two and a half years, the Zenfone actually took really great photos. The 64 megapixel mode could capture clear signs on a building from half a mile away. One day, it just started taking bad pics. So when I heard of all of the hype behind the Pixel 4a and the fantastic photographic abilities, I was really excited. I'm not one to spend a massive amount on a phone, so the idea of getting a ""flagship class"" camera at an affordable price really got my attention. I waited about a month to receive the phone. I liked the lack of bloatware. I immediately changed the swiping features to the old fashioned buttons at the bottom of the screen. Just couldn't get the hang of the gestures. I find the height of the screen just right. I've come to hate the narrow width, which make me feel like I'm breaking my thumbs when I key. Mind you, I don't have large hands, but for me personally, it beats the heck out of my thumbs to key with the 4a. I like the screen overall. The blacks are deep. The screen is a little too cool for me, so I actually prefer to use the phone in night mode and switch to normal when I'm talking pics. HOWEVER, there are often occasions when the screen stutters when scrolling through web pages. It's not on every page, but I will invariably see stuttering on multiple webpages over the course of the day. I have never seen this behavior in my old Zenphone...ever. Another annoyance is the frequency with which my 4a refuses to load a webpage. Maybe a few times a day, I'll run a search for something and the phone will freeze while opening the webpage. The progress meter will just hang at about 10% and the page won't open. Maybe 30 seconds later, eureka, it opens. Given none of our other phones in the family do this, I don't believe it's a WiFi thing. It must be buggy software. One thing that really irritates me... Let me explain. Let's say I open the Google app and search for 'Moon Landing'. I find an interesting article that mentions Neil Armstrong. I copy Neil Armstrong, open another Google windows and search for him. When I want to go back to the Moon Landing article, which I minimized to search for Neil, well...it's gone! If you try to open the Google app more than once, the original window will disappear in favor of the new window. This NEVER happened on my Zenfone. I could open Google a dozen times and search many different topics. If I minimized a window, I could always return to it. Why the Pixel 4a doesn't work that way is baffling. In-fact, I sat the two phones side by side and tried this. Every time, the Pixel would close the minimized Google window. Yet the Zenfone gave me many Google tabs to work with. For me personally, this is the worst feature (or non-feature) of the 4a. The stereo speakers sound quite nice. No real complaints there. Battery life. It's really so-so. I'm not exactly a power user. I keep the screen brightness in the lower third of the scale. I tend to scroll through the news in the morning, watch a few news clips and maybe some YouTube and I find myself recharging at about mid-day if I want to make it to the evening. Google should really have given the 4a a larger battery. I imagine, given how batteries degrade over time, that in a year or so, this battery will have pretty sad life. So finally, the camera... Portraits are something to behold. I've been into photography for a long time now and I've got to say that the 4a is one of those cameras that captures the ""soul"" of the subject--a real old-fashioned Kodachrome feel. Night mode is decent overall, though it tends to capture weird pixelated halos around store signs that are quite distracting and that I never witnessed in my Zenfone's better days. Aside from the above, the 4a takes a nosedive on most other photos. If you're a pixel peeper, you're not going to be happy. Let's imagine a daylight photo taken of a row of building 50 meters away. Upon initial inspection the photo will look pretty good. Colors are vivid and accurate. Zoom in on a photo and the pics become very pixelated and ""artifacty"". Distinct lines are broken and edgy. Actually, I'd call them mushy, not unlike my sick Zenfone. Unfortunately, I take a lot of landscape photos and there are times when computational photography can't make up for raw megapixel count. Frankly, in it's prime, my old Zenfone would have trounced all over the 4a in landscape photography--and by a wide margin. No kidding. It's really up to you what you do. I know a lot of folks are happy with the 4a. With respect to photography, if you do almost entirely portraits, you should be happy. I would definitely pick something else of I had it to do again. I'm not making a recommendation, just giving my opinion. I'd certainly go for something with a bigger battery and a better sensor for landscape photography. Best wishes!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Review after One week - Excellent product. Light weight and Handy, No lag with 730G processor, Smooth and Clean UI, Best in Class camera even without wide angle lens, Average battery back up. Overpriced in India but still value for money.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Is the camera super high resolution? No, but the processing is great and you don't need more than 4,000 pixels wide for social media posts. Is the battery super high capacity? No again, but I never need to charge it more than once per day, and at the end of the day I still have 20 hours of battery left. Maybe if you shoot a lot of video this phone wouldn't hold out long, but for my very average usage it's fine. Does it have a fancy glass or metal case? No, but most people with fancy looking phones put a case on them anyway. Or they crack. Does it have a punch hole camera? Yes, and here's my only major gripe. I never use the selfie camera, and Netflix seems to be the only major streaming app that can stretch to full screen. All of the other apps I have (Hulu, HBO Max, Prime Video) slam the video to the right hand side which will round off the corners of 16:9 video. The punch hole itself doesn't even bother me anymore. I just want full screen video in my streaming apps, and it's not even Google's fault on this one. The verdict is that the Pixel 4a is a solid budget smartphone. It gets regular security updates, is probably getting Android 12, doesn't have a terrible app launcher, and isn't going to crack like my glass back Motorola X4.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Just received it. So far I love it. Lots of storage. Fastest phone I ever owned. Camera is awesome and fun to play with. Charges fast but gets warm while it charges which cud be a safety hazard maybe? Overall I'm impressed with my first Google phone verses Samsung. Get 3 years of updates so I will be keeping this phone for at least 3 years if not longer if I'm still happy with the phone. Not laggy like my old Samsung galaxy J7 was super slow at some tasks. This phone moves a lot faster than my old outdated phone. Thanks Google,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"pros: Great phone light fast awesome camera simple Cons: Some days the battery life can be an issue, but this is mostly remedied by the fact that the phone takes nothing to charge, and that it completely depends on usage. Learning curve going from samsung to google's interface I find it interesting that this phone has bridged the understanding gap of how i-phone's UI works for an android user. The battery life is hit or miss depending on your usage, on heavy days, I will have to charge by afternoon, but on days I barely look at my phone, it seems to last over 24hrs.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Speakers not loud enough and poor quality. Battery does not last a full day of normal use.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Mine replaced a Pixel (1). I loved the fingerprint reader on the back. My wife upgraded hers earlier and got a Pixel 3 which still had the reader on back. Camera is awesome, battery life seems to have doubled but maybe just a new phone and size. I did not need the 5G microwave blasting me. 4G is just fine. Like the new features like swipe to go back...too bad not also swipe forward in browser (I hate that on a phone). Camera nice, but could have been better.

"The last year or so has been a concern for me because I was afraid the mid-range phone I bought three years ago would break. The new offerings have not been compelling, mainly offering better cameras but not significantly stronger processing and smaller manufacturing processes (e.g. 7nm). That has changed just in the past few months and even days as there are now at least three compelling mid-range phones. I bought the Pixel 4a because it was: (1) One of the least expensive; (2) Offers one of the best OS upgrade/update policies; and (3) Is not made in China or by a Chinese firm--pick your reason not to like China right now--there are at least four. There are things I wish it had, primarily microSD and a SD 765G processor, but the 730 is plenty fast. IMHO, we're well past the stage where most people have any real need for flagship processors (gamers excluded) I'll upgrade my wife's phone to 5G later, we would mainly need that for tethering, and we don't both need it. It will probably be the 5G version of the Pixel 4a or the Samsung 51. The packaging is fairly basic, containing the phone, a 120 volt charging block, USB-C cable and a sim tool. Also, it has a very useful adaptor from the large plug USB to USB-C. That is given to help connect to your old phone, but is also useful for Yubi security keys. The phone came roughly 60% charged and didn't require any security updates that I noticed, having Android 10 installed with security updates current to within 15 days (which makes me think I missed a security update being installed). As to the phone, it's roughly the same size as what I'm used to coming from a Moto 5G Plus, but it is slightly narrower. Overall I like the change. I have not noticed any lag, and overall the phone seems very responsive, as it should coming from a phone that is over three years old in design. I wasn't sure I'd like the fingerprint scanner on the back, but that has been fine. Setting up was a bit more difficult in that the automatic transfer process the phone tries to start apparently did not work at all, or maybe I'm just not patient enough. My old phone said ""preparing"" for over 20 minutes without any indication of progress on either phone. Setting up the old fashioned way was very quick, with my roughly 150 apps installing quickly. The only problem I've had is related to my Google Suite Account, which in the newer version of Android becomes a work account. That keeps me from signing into Google maps with that account, which I'm still trying to work around. If you don't have a paid Google Suite Account this shouldn't be an issue. I also had to change a few of the default settings, but surprisingly few. I turned off a few things to save battery life, such as monitoring for songs in the background, and turned on the virtual navigation keys at the bottom of the screen, which I prefer to their gestures system. Too early to say anything about battery life because my use of the phone has been far from normal. I'll report back if it can't get through a normal day with at least 25% of battery left.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Most user unfriendly phone. The fingerprint reader is awkwardly placed on the back of the phone instead of where the thumb naturally lies. The user controls for navigating internet pages and toggling between programs is very unintuitive. Google Chrome keeps stating it needs to be updated but refuses to update on the phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Luego de probar el teléfono una semana, mis conclusiones más relevantes (y por las cuales recomiendo este teléfono), son las siguientes: - Cámara 9/10. Sólo le falta versatilidad, en calidad visual y detalle de lo MEJOR que hay en el mercado. En video es bueno, pero se podría haber mejorado un poco más (apple sigue siendo superior en esto). - Tamaño 10/10. Muy ergonómico para el día a día, fácilmente se puede ocupar con una sola mano, liviano. - Software 8.5/10. Android de Google va muy fluido en este dispositivo, a pesar de que el chip 730G es inferior a otros (765G). Puntos positivos, los 3 años de actualizaciones, Google assistant y que no tiene app's basura como MIUI y Samsung. Sin embargo android 11 hay que mejorarlo un poco más, lo cuál es entendible ya que se ha actualizado recientemente. - Batería 7/10. Para mi uno de los puntos más ""flojos"". Google hizo una buena optimización con el consumo de la batería y se debe destacar, fácilmente se puede llegar a un día de uso (en cuarentena he ocupado bastante el consumo multimedia, YT, instagram). Sin embargo, no sé cómo se comportará en un año más, razón por la cuál hubiera agradecido tener una batería de al menos 3400 mA o más. - Diseño y Construcción 7/10. Destacar que el teléfono en mano se ve mucho mejor que en fotos, o entrega una sensación un poco más premium de lo que realmente esperaba. El acabado en plástico me da cierta sensación de fragilidad si el teléfono se llegara a caer y temo por la pantalla (espero estar equivocado). Por último, visualmente se debe mejorar, sigue siendo un teléfono poco atractivo para la mayoría de usuarios. Creo que si Google mejorara sus diseños, podrían atraer a muchos más consumidores. -Precio 10/10. A pesar del costo de envío e importación, sigue siendo mejor alternativa que los modelos que se venden en mi país (Huawei, Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, etc.) por el mismo precio.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I hate that the charging cord is c to c on both ends. That means you need to take your charger with you. Stupid. Great my car has USB plugs I can't use. I looked into getting a fast-charging USB to c cord but the cord mfg didn't recommend it for the pixel lines. Btw this phone listens to you all the time. Even with google voice turned off.

Haven't used the battery too much (+ the google battery AI hasn't been trained yet), so can't judge on that. The extra RAM here is great -- I went through my social media, then went back to a heavy game (GTA SA) and it was surprisingly still in memory! I've noticed the phone gets really hot throughout the day, especially when you're charging and using it for video calls. The phone even said that it would start disabling features due to overheating. So maybe avoid charging the phone and using it. That's the only bummer I've had with this phone -- that aside, this is a fantastic budget phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great flagship phone - good price and specs,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I love this phone so far especially considering it's only $350. I'm rough on phones I've broken every phone I've owned except one do with every other phone having a price point of nearly $1000 that's just not something I want to carry around in my pocket all the time.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
None of the finger print did not work,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone! My old phone was slow and froze frequently within the first few months of having it, but the Pixel 4a has none of those problems! The camera is amazing, and has a lot of great settings and options. I will attach a regular picture and a portrait mode picture to show the clarity and great quality. The camera is also quickly accessable by double tapping the lock button on the side of the phone. I noticed that Google Duo has a share screen feature that is available on the Pixel 4a, but not a lot of other phones, and I enjoy having that option. The fingerprint reader works great. The battery lasts a very long time. I use my phone very frequently and usually charge it to 70 or 80% to preserve battery life. Even with all the usage, I usually only have to charge it once a day. It would definitely take a while to die with a full charge so no worries there. The thing I came across the most while researching the phone prior to purchasing was ""it's a great budget phone"" and I 100% agree. I'm no tech expert, but as a regular user, I can say this is the best phone I have ever had. In comparison with the Pixel 4 (which I do not have), the Pixel 4a does have a headphone jack, but does not have wireless charging or the squeeze feature, and is not water-resistant. I have the phone in ""Just Black"" and it is very nice and sleek with a white lock button. There were originally no navigation buttons and the phone directed me to use gestures but I was able to get the navigation buttons that I prefer in the settings. Overall it's a great phone and I highly recommend it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Long lasting battery, works well with T-Mobile, amazing video and picture quality. Light phone. Might buy a second just for video production because it's much cheaper than an iphone or galaxy.

"You’d think only $800+ smartphones are worth it. Then something like the Google Pixel 4a comes along and makes you reconsider. It’s not so much because you’re getting more overall than on a pricier smartphone, but rather it’s the fact that you get a lot for the price of $350 that makes this phone stand out from the pack. The Pixel 4a will tempt even users of high end smartphones to consider the minimalistic, but punchy, approach of Google with this device. It delivers in what matters and it cuts corners where it doesn’t, making us feel uncomfortable about the amounts of money we spend on flagship smartphones. The first thing that will make an impression is the size of the phone. The Pixel 4a is a small phone for 2020. You can handle it with one hand, which says a lot. But even though it’s small, it still provides 5.8 inches of screen real estate, mostly due to the very thin bezels and the punch-hole camera. The body is made of plastic and it’s in a matte black finish. This choice of materials makes the 4a very light, especially when I compare it to my daily iPhone X which feels super heavy with its glass surfaces. Even though beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I did find the back side design a bit dull, lacking any elements that would make it stand out from the crowd. But this is to be expected at this price range. On the back, you’ll find the camera-flash array in the upper left corner, and a fingerprint sensor centrally located. The latter sinks in the back panel, making it easy to find it without looking. On the left side of the phone you’ll find the SIM card tray, and on the right side there are the power and volume buttons. Google made the power button white, which is an interesting choice of color. The top includes a headphones jack (yay) and the bottom provides the USB-C charging port and two speaker holes. The screen is one of the impressive points. Google equipped the Pixel 4a with a wonderful 5.8 inches Full HD+ OLED screen, with a density of 443 ppi and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The screen is very bright and with nice and accurate colors. The responsiveness of swiping and gestures is great, and I didn’t notice any lag while operating the phone. It’s amazing how good this screen is, especially if you think about the price of this device. On the top left corner you’ll find the punch-hole front camera, used for front facing video and selfies. This is a great move by Google to maximize screen area and minimize the bezels around it. It also contributes in the compactness of the device overall, which could be a decisive factor for many potential buyers. What I love about this device is that is provides a decently large screen (5.8 inches) at a size that can be operated with one hand and is also very lightweight (due to the use of plastics instead of the more premium aluminum or glass). Compared to my daily iPhone X, this phone feels smaller and lighter even though the X has the same screen size. Impressive. Unlocking the phone is quite easy; grab the phone and slide your index finger over the fingerprint sensor. I will admit though, I’m too used to Apple’s facial recognition and I’m still trying to get used to this. Also, I wish Google had placed the fingerprint sensor slightly higher. My index finger keeps going higher and then lower, and also my car mount tends to cover the fingerprint sensor unless I slide the device higher when mounting it. But these are no dealbreakers by any means, especially if you think about the price tag. Things regarding performance are simple. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 730G isn’t the sharpest processor out there, but Google had no other option for a device priced at $350. Regardless, the 2.2GHz clocked CPU is perfect for average daily use and moderate power consumption. Sure, it won’t impress in gaming, but it will deliver competently in everything else. The 6GB of RAM memory help the Pixel 4a maintain consistency throughout its performance. 4GB have been proven to not be enough for modern smartphones and thankfully Google packed 6GB in the 4a. That, combined with the 128GB of storage space, will allow users to download and install multiple apps without worrying about any shortcomings. Battery autonomy is great too. With 3140 milliamps per hour, and a low powered CPU, you will most probably get more than 1.5 days of operation time before you have to recharge (provided that the average screen time is around a modest 2-2.5 hours/day). The Google Pixel 4a is equipped with a 12 MP rear camera using the IMX363 sensor, with Optical & Electronic Image Stabilization (OIS + EIS). The aperture is f/1.7 and the field of view is 77 degrees. It can shoot 4K videos at 30fps or 1080p video at 60 fps. The front facing camera has an 8 MP sensor, an f/2.0 aperture and an 88 degrees field of view. The 4a shoots great pictures with nice colors and good dynamic ranges. The contrast is at a good level as well. Overall the pictures look amazing for a $350 device. I have attached some images that show the same picture shot with the Google Pixel 4a, the iPhone X and the iPhone XR. I am really happy with how the pictures from the 4a turned out. The Pixel 4a of this article is rocking the Android 10, June 2020 build. As all Google Android phones, it has a simple but very smooth and to the point GUI. Features such as Google Assistant and Call Screening are present in the 4a, as well as advanced AI functionalities that improve several aspects of the phone (for example, AI image processing of the pictures taken by the rear camera). But maybe the most important software “feature” of a Pixel phone is the guaranteed support for at least three years. That means that the Pixel 4a will be receiving Android updates at least until 2023. Overall the Google Pixel 4a is an amazing mid-level smartphone. It offers plenty of features and functionalities at the very reasonable price of $350 dollars. It excels in many areas, and it manages to mask the few deficiencies it has. The 4a is a very affordable way to experience the pure Android world with Google’s great software support. If you are in the market for an affordable but great Android smartphone, look no more.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Fingerprint reader seems fast and accurate, battery life is good sofar but I've had the phone under a week. It's pictured in a forest green crave case. *Picture was not taken with a 4a, but with a jealous older phone. I don't use face recognition much, so not testing or rating that. *4a and case held by a custom tripod and mount, sold separately. If you can find gnomes to build it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I used this phone for about 2 weeks and constantly was dropped from data. This made the phone essentially useless since several times I could not make a phone call in the middle of town with great reception. I took it in to AT&T and they got it to work in the store. 5 minutes later it was the same thing. I got so frustrated that I gave up. Nothing like buying a new phone and being excited about it and then not having it work most of the time.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I am very happy with my purchase, battery life is the best Ive ever had. came from a Note 8",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought the Pixel 4a after using a Pixel 2XL for two years. There are a lot of wonderful features within the 4a, but I am just not as impressed with it as I was hoping. For the price, it is a stellar phone. It's fast, it's pretty, it doesn't look as cheap as it is, and I honestly can't say anything back about it - besides 2 things. Even after using my 2XL for two years, the battery life is still better than the 4a. I find myself charging the 4a several times a day, whereas I rarely had to charge my 2XL once thought the day. Also, the camera. It is SO fuzzy with the front camera, and the rear camera honestly didn't blow me away. I'm a professional photographer, so I'm a bit snobby about the camera on my phone. Honestly the battery life for the 4a is just okay. If you want a cheap, high quality phone that packs a punch and a half, get this one. I personally am returning mine and buying the 4XL in hopes I'm more satisfied!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Worst phone I've ever owned. There's a big learning curve, and apps crash without notice. I'll be switching back to an iphone 12.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It really gives you that flagship experience at a pretty remarkable and competitive price point of only 349 dollars. It's a no brainer if you're looking for something more than the average $80 walmart cheapo phone. Get this phone! it very much is worth it. And personally. The lack of waterproofing for me is pointless. All my old phones where the same way. Hardly a disappointment. and no wireless charging? Eh? if it cuts off 600~ bucks off the normal 1k price tag that is something I am capable of living with. Also. 128 gb of storage means you basically never run out of space. Compared to my old phone of 12 (8 was taken up by the OS lol) it feels even better!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"There is nothing fancy here (other than maybe the camera), but Google nails everything you actually need. Don't pay $1000 for a phone! Just get this one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Really love the camera!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great functionality and quality. Easy to download all my stuff from an older smartphone to new by myself. I just love this phone more and more. Lots of YouTubes available to help.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is clearly an excellent phone. But if you don't know how to use it it is worthless. And trying to get help from Google is an exercise in frustration. Everyone else in my family has iphones so they cannot help me. And despite spending hours on chats with the Google Pixel help people, I still cannot set up this phone to work in a way that is good for me. And the five icons on the home screen keep changing on their own and I don't know how to stop them from doing that and its driving me crazy. I wish I could just delete them.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone! I literally had to keep reminding myself that I only paid $350 for it because it feels so expensive! The camera is amazing! I couldn't stop taking random pictures of everything the first night I got it. I love the interface and how customizable everything is. The phone is super fast and the fingerprint reader is the fastest I've ever used. And I have a headphone jack! I switched from an iPhone 7 and the adapter in the box made that so easy! I was worried as this is my first non Apple phone, but I don't regret getting a pixel one bit",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4a redefines my view on midrange phones. Performance is great, battery life is better than my past phones (S7, Pixel 3), and takes just as good pictures. For just $350 it's a phenomenal phone that does everything I need it to do. What I wish it had is wireless charging and waterproofing, but I can't complain for again a phone that costs only $350. I'm very happy with it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I bought used from Amazon. Wont work with T-Mobile Network. They sent me 2 different SIM cards and I wasted over an hour on the phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Really like my new phone. Definitely worth the wait and money.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This is a fantastic phone for the price. I'm very pleased. AT&T WiFi Calling works perfectly. I live in a rural community with poor service so this feature is a must. I had difficulty finding information before I ordered about whether or not AT&T supported WiFi calling for this phone. AT&Ts website said it would need a software update. Whatever AT&T had to do happened automatically. They also activated VoLTE which they'll apparently be requiring for all phone in the near future.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I had the 3a and it was the best cell phone I'd owned. This adds a lot more memory and is a perfect fit for my needs. Thank you Google and Google Fi whose chat support is first class!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've looked up so much reviews on this phone and this is the greatest phone I've ever had. It's only been my first day with it, so there's still much to understand about it. This device was able to scan all my songs in seconds compared to my last phone. The camera can see much better than what the eye can see when it comes to lighting. The speed of this phone is unlike any other at products at this pricing. Just don't expect this to be a high end gaming device or a and hd video recorder with high frame rate. Otherwise, If you need a taste of the greatest smart phone experience and not having much on your budget and no need of crazy all the expensive unwanted features, this phone is a must.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Spent half a day and took the phone to three T-Mobile stores. I was embarrassed and humiliated when I was told by employees that the phone was already registered and where I purchased the phone. The phone was not unlocked as advertised. I wouldnot even give one star.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"After two different carrier stores, both told me my phone was defective and to return to seller. Wifi and SIM Card reader both non functioning.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I would never buy a Google Pixel 4a again. The phone simply quit working. The message is: ""Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted and may not work properly."" It gave me a link to go to in order to troubleshoot. I tried everything. Nothing worked. All I get is that screen or a white screen with the Google logo. I researched this problem online and have read that it has happened to many others. I am a very unhappy Pixel customer.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Can't go wrong with this one.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The phone itself is great. Something that has me wondering, though, is that it's supposed to be unlocked but I've found Verizon software pre-installed. How did it get there? Very misleading product overall.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
So the adaptive seems to work alright but eh could be better. I haven't figured out how face recognition works yet or even how to turn it on,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone...my second Pixel. I especially like the size and weight. Love all the built-in Google features. Battery life is a little disappointing, but does not outweigh the pluses.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone if you just want the basics to do everyday tasks (e-mail, social media, selfies, take pictures of random stuff, Youtube, streaming video, online shopping, etc) without the bells and whistles. $350 is an excellent price for what it can do especially if you're on a budget. Unlike a premium $800+ phone it does NOT have 1. Water, Dust Resistance. Have that bag of rice handy just in case, and don't kick it around constantly in dry dirt/sand 2. Active Edge. Unlike the past few pixel phones, cannot squeeze phone for Google Assistant 3. Facial recognition. Has a very responsive fingerprint reader on back. 4. 4K screen. Has 1080p OLED display, 60hz refresh. If your eyes are used to 4k screens with high refresh rate then this may feel like a downgrade, if not, it's manageable. Able to multi-task without any lag (unless your eyes are trained to do so) 5. Wireless charging. Wired fast charging only. 6. Aluminum or glass body: Phone exterior has a uni-body plastic design. Sturdy and fingerprint resistant 7. Support 5G. There is a 5g model coming soon (as of this review) --What it does have/list of features: Excellent camera: Single camera front and back (12MP). No wide angle. excellent post processing software. One of the best cameras on the market (as of this review) even when compared to $1000+ phones especially in astro photography. Front camera is a whole punch design instead of integrated into a bezel. Great Battery life: 10 hour screen on time. Can last 1 to 1.5 days depending on usage It does have headphone jack for those who still use wired headphones Stereo speakers are basic. Able to hear others through speaker phone. Decent bass if you want to listen to music without headphones 128gb storage E-sim option. No need for physical sim if you don't want to use it Has live Caption mode (basically subtitles for your phone for media and phone calls), and Now Playing (tells you what music is playing without going into an app) Has 3 year software and security updates. No bloutwear on phone Overall, excellent price for what you get especially when you want the phone to do basic everyday tasks",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Got this phone over two weeks ago. First time getting a Google phone. VERY Disappointed. Flipping through phone options is slow and delayed, when the phone rings while texting the screen goes black and makes it impossible to actually take the call. Touch is way to sensitive making it hard to actually hold the phone in your hand without dialing/typing.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Just what i was looking for, tho smaller than i thought it would be. And the camera needs no mention, just superb!👌🏽",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I've been rather impressed with this phone since I purchased it. I didn't set it up for about 6 weeks after I purchased it period but since then I've had it for about five weeks up and running and it's been wonderful my only complaint is the battery life is horrible truly is the three phones I've had before this lasted twice as long I can barely get through the day with minimal use period however I'm going to keep the phone it's worth it I love the features on it and it's a little bit smaller than my last phone but I have been able to enjoy it more than I thought I would recommend this product to my family and friends!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Call reception is terrible. Had same carrier with old phone... now with this phone, it keeps cutting in and out.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought this to replace an ailing LG6. I was most impressed with the setup. I did it all in the car, riding as a passenger. You just connect the old phone and the new one with a cable, switch over the SIM card, and start the transfer. It installs the phone with the new SIM card, no waiting at Verizon to do it and then paying them for the non-service. It transfers contacts, photos, and other content. All the apps are setup for transfer, but it waits until you have WiFi to start the process. Non-sensitive ones came over with passwords transferred, too. Sensitive ones, like bank card, mobile banking, and other security-sensitive apps required you to sign on again. Swiping instead of 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen finally had the best of me, but there is an option to install the traditional 3-button controls, and it works like a charm. Still figuring out some of the features, but I've very happy.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"At first I had some concerns about the battery. That's true, that ""Always on display"" is the most energy consuming feature.

"Purchased as a gift. It's the perfect size phone with fast updates, good camera, and fluid UI. The price can't be beat as a mid-range phone. Great value!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone with lot of features and the latest android OS version. Camera is great with the Google software and at this price range. The phone feels small in the hand so if you'd prefer a bigger screen to watch videos, this might not be the best option. Otherwise, this is great of one hand handling.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

A decade of lies from employees is just too much to continue giving them my money.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Been using this for a few weeks and so far am very happy. Replaced a Pixel XL that wouldn't stop randomly rebooting and getting confused about the battery level. It is smaller but I'm not really noticing that. Smaller fits my purse and pocket better. Battery life is awesome!! Great phone that doesn't break the bank. Love the slo mo on the camera.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The 4a loses data/internet connection for seemingly no reason. I walk every morning and listen to podcasts... every morning since I got this piece of junk, it loses internet/data and bricks. It eventually resets but nothing I've tried can fix it. A quick google search tells me this is a common issue. I tried factory reset, restarts, etc... Nope, this is just junk. I would recommend not buying it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Bought this phone for T-Mobile and had zero issues swapping over to the phone from my old phone. Phone has almost all the features I cared about such as unlockable bootloader and headphone jack. The main this phone doesn't have that would be nice is an SD card slot. Wireless charging and LED notification light would have been nice also but over all its a budget phone with specs that can rival even some flagship phones for less then half the price so its to be expected it wouldn't have all the bells and whistles.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Excelente teléfono una excelente cámara trasera y más con su modo nocturno, una cámara frontal modo retrato excelente la verdad no le pide nada a un iPhone. No tiene cámara 2x como un iPhone de dos cámaras pero tiene un 2x digital que no vas a notar la diferencia. También la batería es muy buena te dura todo el día para mí que consumía dos baterías diarias. También es un teléfono muy liviano y el tamaño exvente lo puedes manejar con una sola mano, la verdad lo recomiendo muchísimo porque es un super precio. Te lo dice alguien que tiene un iPhone 12 pro Max. Gracias",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I've been a fan of the Google phone since they released the original Nexus phone over a decade ago. I've been through the good and the bad, and can confidently say that the 4a is one of the best Android phones that I've seen offered from Google. The phone has enough processing power to run the most recent Android operating systems and enough storage for my needs. The battery life is at the top of the pack for Android phones and the camera takes BEAUTIFUL pictures. USB-C charging is fast and the phone works well with third-party chargers. I've had no issues pairing it with my car or headsets and transferring over all of my data from my previous phone was a snap. One *really* nice feature of this phone is that it is dual-SIM capable; you can have both a virtual and a physical SIM. If, like me, you carry a phone for work and a personal phone, you can consolidate down to one device and choose which carrier you use for your outgoing phone calls, and data, while being able to text and call from either number. If you are in the Android ecosystem, this is the phone to get.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I purchased the 4a to assist with Bluetooth function for a Cochlear Implant and a Resound Hearing Aid, It functioned properly for 5 months and then does not connect properly with the Cochlear Implant and the Resound Hearing Aid. The Bluetooth is very difficult to connect to both and does not maintain a connection, therefore making it very difficult for me to comprehend on an Android phone. If you have a similar situation, I would not recommend purchasing a 4a.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Based on my experience i would request you not to buy any product from the above seller. They just rip off your money for the pixel phone i purchased.

"I had this phone for a few days and I just got to say, the hole punch is great. It's unobtrusive and way better than the notch or iPhone SE 2020 bezels if you want to stream content. The night mode is exceptional, and the photo quality is excellent. The only caveat is that it uses an old photo sensor so when you zoom in, there is a bit of noise. This is just nitpicking but the camera is perfect for only $350. Picture quality retains much of the color as well. The phone is also relatively snappy with zero lag. Not as fast as the SE's A13 but it very well gets the job done. Gaming is also fine on this phone. You should probably play medium to low graphics with this mid-range processor. I tested Asphalt 9 and WOT Blitz, and these games run very smoothly on this phone. I experienced no lags and stutters. If you want high frame rates at the highest settings, you should look elsewhere. Now onto battery life. This phone charges around an hour and 15 mins with its supplied 18-watt charger. For me, the phone barely lasted a day, but since I'm at home all day, I don't think that my usage is an accurate representation of the general public. Most people would be FINE with 1 charge/day. No complaints here. Now here's the kicker: you get unlimited high-quality photo storage on Google photos + 128 GB of internal memory. Now that's one hell of a deal! Unless you are a heavy mobile gamer, this is the phone for you. This phone really does make me question if the majority of the population really needs to buy flagship phones anymore...",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

I am 2 days past the return policy so I guess I gatta count my losses on this one. Also if you plug a aux cord and/or headphones into the aux port it's super quiet and can barely hear anything. UPDATE: I got in contact with google and the phone was under warranty so I got to send it in for free repairs. Well they said it would cost to much to fix so I got a certified used phone in return at no extra cost. Well I am still having the same sound issue with the new phone. the AUX port doesn't work.

"You know the scam on the street when someone tries to direct you to a certain store to buy garbage items so that they can get a kickback? Yeah, it's like that. Was using the Honor 6x with Android 7. Was excited to get the updated system. Sorely disappointed! What have done Google?!? So much bloatware on this. Everything has some ad you cannot get rid of (I'm looking at your Print store ad in G Photos here!) Terrible photo/file management. Very poor notification management. When I open my phone, I want to see MY stuff, not YOUR garbage! The app icon management leaves MUCH to be desired. Messaging? What a crowded bunch of ""enhanced"" options. That not enhanced, it is just useless clutter. Oh look, yet another notification for Call blocking while I write this! Yep, third one today and have the notifications turned off. Not from apps I have installed but from Android itself. Glad this has a long return option as I will continue to test it out but so far...the 3 year old phone from a much-maligned company has you BEAT! (and it was $100+ cheaper!)",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Excellent phone and features. No overlayed brand bloat software, no brand promoted apps you can't get rid of, no third party branded internet browser you can't uninstall ,and the pure Android runs really smooth and fast.You can add Firefox,Opera,or any browser you wish. Fits well in one hand for single-handed use while still fitting in a pocket.There's probably nothing better in the price range if you need CDMA and GSM ability in one phone.I transferred all settings,contacts ,messages and phone number with the provided cable and was able to use my old sim with no issues. No hassle. I don't understand why this is often compared to flagship phones in the $600 up range -it's not.Google makes others beside the Pixel 4a if you need 5G or some trendy features. If you are upgrading from a cheaper,outdated OS LG,Samsung,Motorola phone this is a clear winner.Two or three times the ram and most likely double the storage of your old phone. It does have a plastic back,but it's very sturdy without flex and better made than my LG and previous Samsung that will never offer system updates.. The Pixel 4a came with Android 10 and has already updated to 11.Display is good , even in sunlight where cheap phones may not be. The speakers do not rival $800 phones, but they are very good sounding compared to $100-250 phones;much better than the rear firing speakers I was used too. Bluetooth and wireless signal and sound quality are strong as well,with better speed on wireless.. The single lens camera is great for low light and sharp images in .raw or standard .jpeg like most folks use - far superior color, sharpness, and exposure than other phones also rated at 12 MP- but note that you can't adjust the shutter speed or f stop like a S20FE or S10 - but I really don't need three lenses ,I have a dslr for that.There's an 8mp front camera that performs well too. There's no SD card slot,and I initially thought that was a minus since I use a 64GB SD for music.But I don't have any problems with the 128GB. You can swap or copy files to/from a PC or tablet with a 3.0 USBA to usb C cable like any phone; perhaps slower depending on your PC or tablet USB ratings.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This is a great phone in every way. Couldn't be any happier!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought this for my son and realized it does not have wireless charging after opening it Christmas morning. I tried to return it but Google only lets you return items after 15 days, this was purchased as a gift more than 15 days before Christmas so I can't return it. Why would Google miss the mark on this, it's a standard feature for phones now, similar to not including a camera on a phone..",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Everything is awesome. Don't mind my 5 star rating for face recognition - it's because I don't like this feature and this phone doesn't have one. I like plastic body even if it creaks a bit from pressure. The phone is cold, you can make video calls for more than 2-3 hours and play something - your pixel won't heat your hand too much. Stereosound is another cool addition. Battery is perfect for medium/high usage for 1 day. I use my phone with transparent silicon case and tempered glass in front. Screen protector doesn't fill all the space to the corners so I'm still trying to find another glass for full screen coverage. Hope this phone will age well. I changed my pixel 1 to this 4a and this is definitely a large step forward.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have used oneplus 7t pro, pixel 4 Xl, IPhone 11 pro, S20 and finally pixel 4a in that order for the past year. After using the pixel 4a for 2 days, I can easily say this is my favorite phone of the bunch. Very happy with the placement and speed of the fingerprint reader as opposed to the not so accurate one on the one plus and s20 on screen fingerprint. Very happy with the battery life, as opposed to the crappy battery on the S20 with exynos chip. My favorite camera to take photos, just like the pixel 4. Best software experience, same as the pixel 4, and finally it costs 350 dollars, which is only half the price of the least expensive phone on the list!!!! This is by far the best value for money I have ever seen in a phone. Biggest downside was the 60 hz refresh rate after coming from the 120 hz in the S20, but I can't really complain given this is marketed as a ""budget phone"". If you are just looking for the basics in a phone and want consistency, this is the phone to get.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Phone is great. Battery lasts almost all day, is speedy and has sufficient storage. If you're looking for a great phone on a budget this is the one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It's a useful smartphone, can't give it 5 stars based on the limited review criteria. I can't get used to navigating to and from apps. I find it unintuitive in too many instances.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Good phone, good value. Plenty of memory, but wish they added SD slot for more memory.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Picked up my Pixel 4a through Visible a couple of days ago. So far, this is an excellent phone and exactly what I needed. I read a lot of reviews here and elsewhere, so I'll address my trepidations were buying the Pixel 4a. My phone before the 4a was a Pixel 2. I was, overall, happy with this phone although it was clearly dated. Build quality and plastics Some reviews suggested that the phone felt like a toy. It's made out of plastic and does lack that certain feel of glass or metal (I prefer metal, like the Pixel 2, myself), it's well put together and feels good in the hands. I don't think it feels like a toy or cheap although it doesn't feel like a flagship phone, and that's fine because the 4a is clearly a midrange feel. I personally prefer plastic to glass as it seems more sturdy. There's no flex or anything else, and the phone feels very solid. Form factor One of the biggest selling points of the 4a is its compact form factor. I hate large phones. Phone sizes have creeped up over the years and before getting my Pixel 2 renewed on Amazon I was using a Nokia phone that was considerably bigger. It never felt comfortable in the hand. The Pixel 4a might, if anything, feel a bit too small but maybe that's because my P2 was slightly bigger. Once I slipped a cover on (the X-level Google Pixel 4a Case Slim Fit) it felt perfect. I usually avoid covers because the phones feel too bulky afterward but that's not the case with the 4a. Screen Love the screen. Some people may not like the hole punch for the camera but it doesn't bother me. I know a lot of Android phones are moving up from 60hz to 90 or 120 hz (higher hz creates smoother scrolling and movement). The 4a sticks with 60hz and I think that's fine. Apple also sticks with 60z and for a good reason: it's better on battery life. Most TVs are still 60hz as well, I don't think most people will be bothered by 60hz unless coming from a higher hz phone. Colors are great, the resolution means you don't see pixels. While some reviews complained about brightness, I find the 4a is plenty bright. The screen is pretty reflective, however. Swiping and touch input registers well in my experience. The screen does gather fingerprints quicker than I'd like. Battery Life I was worried about battery life but so far the 4a doesn't struggle with moderate usage and lasts all day easily. Most importantly, Google seems to really have optimized standby power usage. If I leave my 4a off the charge and don't use it for 8 hours (tested while sleeping) I only lose about 2 percent. If I left my P2 off the charger, it'd still drain pretty quickly and I'd come back with like half the battery left (in fairness, the battery is pretty old now). Internals The biggest downside to the P4a is probably the internals, but it's important to remember that this phone only costs $350. The processor and ram offer for a good user experience, and while power users may need something more powerful, I doubt it'll affect me for at least 2 or 3 years. The 6gb ram ensures good multitasking. The battery is a bit small, but as noted above, battery life is solid if not excellent. There's no 5G, which is a big downside. The P4a 5G was too big for me so I skipped that. With my own usage, I doubt the lack of 5g will affect me much, but for future proofing and what not, I'd definitely still rather have it. Fingerprint reader Snappy, accurate, and you can enable downswips to bring up notifications, which is really convenient. Some reviewers complained that the thumbprint reader was too shallow and hard to find. I disagree, after a few minutes of usage, I could find it every time quickly. Now I have a cover on so the thumbprint reader is much deeper. Charging Charges pretty quickly but other companies are installing faster charging in their phone. The P4a using 18w charging, I know some phone companies are using 30w (not much faster in real life) and 65w charging (substantially faster). It'd be nice to have faster charging. No wireless charging either, which would be a nice added feature. But again, this is a $350 phone. Android I like Pixel phones because they offer the best android experience IMO. That's the same here. I wish Google offered 4 years of support (like apple) instead of 3 but either way it's a great experience. Conclusion I am a moderate user in regards to phones, I play simple games, check email, message people, etc. For my uses, the Pixel 4a is a close to perfect phone, and while there are some shortcomings, I just remind myself that this is a $350 phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love this phone a lot. It has a ton of storage, an amazing camera. My only issue is that it's a little small but that's due to being used to bigger phones. I recommend if you need a good phone under 400.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm not an expert in cell phones, but I really liked my earlier version of version of the Google Pixel. So after researching mid-priced phones, the 4a seemed like a good choice. It came quickly and I was able to transfer data in a reasonable amount of time. It functions well and the battery life gets me through the day without issues (I don't stream a lot, but have frequent calls, internet searches, email checks, and a get into several apps during the day). I suppose wireless charging would be nice, but not having had that before, I'm perfectly fine with wired charging. They camera works well and takes great pictures. It's fast and I will probably stick with the Pixel line.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Works as it should. No issues after several months.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I loved almost every second of this Google Pixel 4a. The frosted case is very comfortable to hold. I enjoy how easily it slipped into my pocket, or how easily it is to use with single hand. I've had zero performance issues so far. I was surprised there was no sort of slowdown or sluggishness at all. I've owned several android phones and had the Pixel 4a for a while. It’s performed pretty much flawlessly, both the software and the hardware. I haven’t been easy on trying to push the 4a to its limit. It works so well and smooth on its system. The best part is when I am wearing the face mask, it is fantastic to have a fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone. The battery life of this new 4a has been good enough. I was able to get through a full day using, but just barely. If it is used heavily like watching youtube/ Netflix/ playing games for a long time, I think the backup power will be required. I am a Google fan so I installed a lot of smart devices in my house. The google assistant connects my Nest ring camera, Nest AC control, Google home, switches. If you need to set reminders, open apps, send messages, adjust the settings, of control your smart home, instead of scrolling and clicking, all can be set up through voice control on google assistant. And I was very surprised by the quality of the photos my 4a taked. I do love all cam features! And the night mode feature!! I am in love with it as you dont need to be professional to take amazing night and light shots.I believe that the phones at the same price are not comparable to it. The speakers are with high quality and bass! Transcribe feature works good. Screen resolution is beautiful as well. I am very grateful that Pixel 4a uses the classic 3.5MM headphone jack. You know that all good headphones use 3.5mm. Now I can use my headphone without a conncter. Overall, it’s a great phone! I would highly recommend it. I think the 4a is worth for its price.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have small hands. Most of the phones out there are big now. And I am looking for a small phone that is not premium or flagship priced. And Pixel 4a meets that need. Since there are already excellent reviews in YouTube and Amazon, I will just add my personal experience with the phone. Pixel 4a fits nicely in my hand now. I can use the phone with one hand without fumbling it. My previous phone Moto G7 while great still was a little big for my hands. I do not support iPhone ecosystem, so I was looking for Android. My wife's phone Pixel 3a was great in my hands so I thought I would check out Pixel 4a and it has bigger screen yet smaller than 3a! So I grabbed it and using it for a month, I am really satisfied. Size and weight are perfect and the performance is more than I need (I am not a gamer, so I don't need a powerful processor). The screen is OLED and is clearly better than IPS LCD screens. The colors are just more rich and pop out than IPS LCD. Battery lasts more than 1 full day (my average screen time is between 3 - 4 hours). And the camera! Wow... It is really good. I've heard it was good, but actually seeing it - I was really impressed. The ONLY thing I wish Pixel 4a had was: Water and dust proof feature (IP 68). But for $350, this phone is amazing. And you also get 3 year software update guarantee. So if you are not looking for a premium phone, but something small yet powerful and takes great pictures, then Pixel 4a is an excellent choice! Highly recommended!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I upgraded to Android 11. My camera can no longer be used normally. I can’t use the rear lens without dropping it on the ground or getting water. After turning the camera apps on, there is a black screen. I need to wait a few minutes to see the image. Even if I see the image, it is blurred and out of focus, and it will get stuck immediately. This makes me very bad for the pixel 4a. I think the core advantage of the pixel 4a as a cheap phone is that its camera function is comparable to flagship phones. But when I can no longer use its camera function, it loses its appeal to me. Can’t use the rear the lens is a problem even for daily use. I can't even scan the QR Code. I am quite disappointed with Google phones. I hope someone can help me solve the problem. I have tried using safe mode, using Third-party camera software, clearing camera data, and even Restoring the phone to the factory settings, but I still can't restore my camera functions.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Great phone overall. Exceptional camera details and options, long 24 hr battery life. On average, with consistent use between work and home on a 14 hours day, I charge my phone about once. It can also last without the charge within that time frame. Wonderful sound quality too, which I was apprehensive about at first since my last phone was very popular for it's great sound quality. I dig the customizable interface/themes for your phone. Previously had the ZTE Axon 7, a new Asian tech brand that lasted me a solid 3 years before deciding on this new Google Pixel 4a. I made the right choice when upgrading this fall, and for a very attractive, modest price! I highly recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't want to spend a grand on a new smartphone. ☺️",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I got this phone after replacing my S9+ and although the specs are not as high as my old phone, this phone runs smoother because of the stock android. The battery is crazy good, it lasted me all day whereas the s9+ would last me all day but it would be less than 50%.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I bought this from Google and traded in my 3A for $120. This is a fine phone for the price but if you have a 3A you might consider holding off. This has a larger screen in a smaller body but with a different aspect ratio you don't gain much in display area. You do gain double the amount of storage but that is good only if you need it. There is more memory (6G vs 4G) so that could be a factor in operating speed and convenience but I don't see that right now. I do see some increase in battery charge as it's easier to go 2 days or more between charges.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Solid phone for minimalist lifestyle. Nothing fancy but does everything right. Amazing and intuitive camera that finds the right shot for you super fast. Battery life lasts me a solid day with some battery life to spare with fairly heavy media consumption. The most pocketable phone I've had in quite some time even with a slim case on it. Love this phone, recommend it to minimalist types and parents looking to get their teen something nice, something with a name behind it and won't break the bank.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Don’t waste your money, iPhone se is far away better buy .

"I originally had a Pixel 3a for a year but decided to sell it in May 2020 to try something else. I went to a Xiaomi Note 9 Pro, Samsung S20 FE, Realme 6 Pro, Samsung S20 FE again, and now the Pixel 4a. I could have avoided all of those phones if I just stuck with Pixel. The instant security and OS updates, compact form factor, ease of flashing custom ROMs and reverting back to stock with Google's online tool, excellent battery life, and bloat free, fast software experience are what make Pixel the best. I commonly get 6.5hrs screen on time with auto brightness and light theme on. Although I really enjoyed the Xiaomi and Realme, they do not support VoLTE and WiFi calling in the US with US carriers. Samsung even though they have the best hardware, OneUI is by far my least favorite Android skin. I was GLAD to lose the superior screen, speakers, 5G, 120Hz, and WiFi 6 on the S20 FE to go to the lesser Pixel because the software experience is just that much faster and better. I forgot how much faster and more accurate physical fingerprint readers were compared to the in screen ones. Pixel 4a is definitely the phone you should go for. In my experience, 5G in my area is really not better, if not worse than 4G LTE especially since the 5G in my area is low band non stand alone. The 5G speeds were the same as 4G and I experienced higher latency in certain areas. For this reason I'd choose the 4a over the 4a 5G unless you want the bigger screen. The 4a should have been $299 to compete more with the OnePlus Nord N10 but the extra $50 is well worth it for the longer software support Pixel provides. Overall an excellent phone and I HIGHLY recommend it after having used most major phone brands within a short period of time.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I switched from the old iPhone SE to this phone. I never needed the bells and whistles of the high end phones but I have always resented not having a good camera. The camera on this is great, it is better than the one on the newer iPhone SE. I don't need newer ""high end"" 2 or 3 lens camera systems of the higher end phones. It's overkill for me. I just wanted to be able to take basic photos including low light and it does this very well. Three years of updates sealed the deal. I will never willingly pay 1K for a ""high end"" phone. 349 is about the most I would ever pay, otherwise I would buy one used.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm coming from a samsung android note 9. Loved my note 9 but turns out I'm not that good with big bulky all glass expensive phones... Who woulda thought🤔 ... My whole back of my note 9 phone was shattered and the screen was cracked and I had an otterbox on it the entire time I had the thing. Long story short I bought the phone out after 2 years to switch services and when I went to switch they took my case off to switch sim cards and it was a shattered mess which I was highly disappointed about because I thought it was in good shape!. I could have gotten it fixed for around $400 or I could get a different phone. I didn't want nothing hella expensive I'm tired of having to pay extra for phone payments and then just breaking them because obviously I'm just not good with phones! I wanted something budget friendly with a good quality camera but still similar to androids system. I've been team android forever now I just really don't care for their picture quality though, I have tried iphone out as well I had the iphone x and it just wasn't for me, however I did love the picture quality, so since I've tried both ios and android and have certain things I like and disliked for both of them I figured it was time to give pixels a try! Pros: This phone is cute, little, and light weight phone, but like not so little that the screens no good. The screen to phone ratio is super nice and makes the phone feel smaller with a good sized screen. Which is what I wanted I was over having huge, heavy bulky phones, I have little hands and I constantly was dropping my bigger phones... Picture quality is awesome! It def beats android and I think it might even beat iphones! Easy set up with transferring from my old phone to this one. The backs plastic! Which that was what I was looking for! People complain that ""oh its so boring looking with the plain black plastic back""... I don't get it, so youd rather have a pretty glass back that you end up covering with a bulky case... Cause that makes so much sense... I like how you can either have the navigation buttons or you can use the swipe controls. I like this so your not stuck with one or the other. battery lifes pretty good the charge seems to last me as long as my note 9 did. It def seems very durable. I do have a screen protector along with a case on this phone, not even a good case or screen protector just something cheap I grabbed. I've dropped the phone a few times now and no have had no issues! Volume is also pretty good Cons: My biggest pet peeves with this phone isssss I hate the way screen shots are on this phone! Okay so the power button and the volume down button is how you take screen shots, which is normal for screen shots but on this phone the volume buttons and the power button are on the same side which makes it awkward to do and then sometimes when doing it the volume bar will pop up and turn everything all the way down and the bar just stays there which is annoying.... I don't like how there's not as much customization as androids would have, such as changing the themes and stuff which sorta disappoints me. Conclusion: All in all, the pixel 4a really is not a bad budget phone for people like me that are just to rough for these high end all glass, thousand dollar phones... I would eventually like to get one of the nicer pixels this one was mostly to try it out and see if I even like them before getting one of the more expensive ones later down the road. Nice thing about pixels even there higher end phones such as the pixel 5 arent robbing you like some of these dang androids and iphones are! If your looking for a nice budget phone you won't go wrong getting this one. Would recommend!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It has been a long wait, as my old Pixel continued to deteriorate, but glad that I was able to upgrade to now my favorite Android phone. The Pixel 4a is amazing, the colors are a little bit different than my old Pixel, but I know I had the same situation when I was moving from my Nexus 5x. This phone is beautiful and with multiple applications open, it's fast and smooth. I'm using the eSim with T-Mobile and that works great. I have spent a couple hours using it and really no complains, it's light, but not flimsy and my Spigen Hybrid case doesn't add much to it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Was a gift to my dad, who has been using a Nexus 6P for awhile. This is a huge upgrade for him. I could have got him a cheaper android, or an expensive iphone, but i settled for a pixel. I myself use a pixel 2 since 2017 I think, and am happy with it, so that had me leaning toward pixel to gift him. He says it has good battery and is fast. It is also much lighter than the nexus 6p. Seems comparable in size and feel go my pixel 2. Overall, a Good cheaper iphone alternative. Basic phone Setup took less than 10minutes. I simply took the simcard out his old phone and popped it into the pixel 4a. He uses consumer cellular. He says it works great. I noticed he needs the email account setup to access apps in the play store, however. Will update this review with any more information as time passes.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It was seamless to transfer all my data from my old phone. Fingerprint reader is on backside of phone, but surprisingly more comfortable to use. Camera is what really makes this phone more relevant compared to other bargain smart phones. The battery last all day, even for mobile gamers.

"[May 7, 2021 thoughts on Pixel 4a, ordered November 8, 2020 and used daily ever since] PROS: Form factor and weight- This is the best marriage I have found. Fantastic screen real estate, sensible (ideal?) resolution, and just terrific dimensions for me. This thing is light weight for its size, and I love that more than I can possibly express. Hand fatigue has been all but completely eliminated. Give me plastics, baby! I have no desire for metals that don't add to functionality (and apparently, from something I saw on YouTube, this phone is insanely rugged, even with a plastic shell). Glass is always heavier and less durable than other materials choices, and it's just altogether not well suited for the backside of a mobile handset, IMO. I think Apple charges $550 to replace the back glass on most modern iPhones. This Pixel 4a is the total package and stickers for $200 less than the price of Apple's back glass repair. Price:Performance- While I can't compare this phone to another of its kind with a higher performing Qualcomm, I am never wanting for speed. This phone has been wonderfully fluid and performant for my day-to-day needs. The lean Android experience on the Pixel line really lets its mid-range Qualcomm shine. I most recently carried both an iPhone 7 Plus and 2020 SE, and both proved plenty fast for anything I do; this 4a is no exception. Background app refreshes seem to be on par with what I had using 3GB iPhones. No real surprises. My day-to-day habits seem mostly unaffected by any background app refreshes I've noticed. I think the 6GB of memory strikes a good balance for the 4a. I don't game. Well, I play some chess now and again, including occasional analysis using very demanding engines (Stockfish, etc), but in general I can't comment on gaming performance. Battery- Battery life and charging time have been lovely. I seldom charge to 100-percent, instead I prefer to just give little 5- to 15-minute charges periodically during the day, while keeping the battery in the 30- to 70-percent range where possible. This thing charges way, way faster than my older 7 Plus and 2020 SE iPhones and overall battery life is likely comparable or better from what I can gather (very unscientifically). I leave it to the readers to determine how important battery life is and do some research of their own. Camera- It's so good it doesn't even make sense. Shooting stills, the 4a smashes my old iPhone 7 Plus my a wide margin and the 2020 SE couldn't hold a candle either. I think that's being objective. I've had quite a bit of low-level, professional photography training at University level and time behind the lens of DSLRs, and I'm quite astonishing that I can get such quality images from the 4a. The software image processing is pure magic. I have kids, and they're the important subjects for me. I'd guessed the 4a might struggle with motion, particularly in lower light, which would have been a deal-breaker for me, but this thing takes ""keepers"" practically every single time. Glorious. Most already know how well Pixel phones shoot non-moving subjects, so I won't carry on about that. It's an exciting camera experience. Concerning video, the 1080p 30- and 60-frame shooting has not disappointed either, and the image stabilization is truly excellent. I don't mess with 4k on phones (yet), so no comment there. I don't take selfies, so I won't comment on the front-facing camera either. Android- The gesture navigation is fantastic, particularly the ability to go back by swiping in from either the left- or right-hand side of the display. Massively convenient and easy on the hands. Updates/security patches are crucial for me, and with a Pixel, scorching fast updates are what you get, and support duration bests most Android-based OEMs. Fingerprint recognition- Works as well and as fast as any I've experienced. Thought the rear placement would bug me. It absolutely does not. Rear placement is probably my preference now. Well executed. I like. CONS: Audio volume/intensity- The 4a just doesn't get as loud as some other modern handsets. It's tricky to listen to a podcast or whatever when I'm doing dishes, for example. That said, the audio quality is perfectly satisfactory, to me. Google Search- There's a Google search bar installed by default on the home screen. I leave mine there and find it useful. When tapped, you're presented with the ability to ""search apps, web, and more..."" (much like the search on iOS when you pull down from the top). Google/Android learns over time, so that eventually it can quickly present you with what you're most likely to want. Works great, more often than not. But the problem for me is that it's inconsistent with regards to displaying apps. It must be that about 20-percent of the time it doesn't display apps, so I'm forced to swipe up from the bottom of the display to close the interface, then tap the Google search bar again before it populates apps in the query. I can't figure out what causes this for the life of me, and I've owned an IT MSP for years, so this ain't my first rodeo with tech devices! Frustrating, but muscle memory makes this only a half-second affair to correct. Dependability- I've long used the same MVNO for cell service, which I mention only because there exists a small possibility that it's of importance here: I've found a few occasions where I can't place phone calls. To fix, for some reason, a reboot was required. I haven't had any issues in the past few months, but it's probably because I've changed habits; now, whenever there's an update to something low-level from Android (not just a basic app update), I reboot the phone. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?? Anyway, I'd have a ""need"" to reboot an iPhone maybe once every six months, outside of forced reboots from doing an iOS update. To have had to monthly (or maybe even more frequently) reboot this 4a in order to connect phone calls (with no warning as to any trouble, unless I attempted to place a call and ""connect the dots"") is unfortunate. I don't like to have to think about mitigating critically buggy behavior by rebooting my phone from time to time. OLED- I'm sensitive to flicker, so I basically hate OLED. My daily driver laptop is a ThinkPad T480s LARGELY because its 1080p IPS is flicker-free (no PWM). This 4a gives me viewing fatigue after a relatively short while. On the 4a, unless you're at max brightness (exactly 100-percent), you can expect flicker in the ~122 to 255Hz range. That's too low for me. I would prefer an LCD, like the ones I had in my iPhone 7 Plus or 2020 SE. I could view those endlessly without fatigue- read books on them, you name it. But the industry does trend, and trend it does for the contrast ratio specs and inky blacks the kids rave about these days {rolls eyes}. Overall: This is probably the finest overall set of compromises I've ever found in a cell phone, and I've owned many of them since 1994. I'm highly satisfied with this handset, and I think very little could realistically be done today to improve upon the formula that is the Pixel 4a. Google has made a proper phone for adults. 9/10 DO recommend!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Fingerprint reader too much trouble. Phone has performed very good. Images clear. Satisfied.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I like the size and the battery life of the phone. The screen is extremely sensitive so when online it can change the page easily or it can hang up during phone calls.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm really happy I waited and did my research and bought this phone! It works so well and it's really nice looking. Here are some things to note: 1) It can plug into your old phone and copy EVERYTHING over, which is so cool! And saves time. 2) Setup and customization is easy 3) I have TMobile and Wifi Calling works! Exactly what I need since I have bad service in my area 4) Get a screen protector and/or case because the screen is not gorilla glass. Be careful with it. 5) The battery can drain quickly unless you're in dark mode/battery saver. I like dark mode now. Buuut the charger that comes with the phone will charge it fully in less than an hour. I don't use fingerprints or facial recognition so I can't comment on that.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I'm going to be honest and keep it short, the phone is beautiful. BUT the battery life is not what people say it is.. I'm usually a heavy user but the first 24 hrs of owning the phone i wasn't using it much, and I am extremely disappointed in GOOGLE right now! Because the same thing happened when i bought my new pixel 3a last year i thought this was going to be better all these youtubers lie and say battery life is great and i end up buying these pixels and it's actually crap.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I've been using Samsung phones for years now, so I was nervous about switching.. but so far I have no complaints about this phone! I bought this because while I liked my S10 just fine, I somehow broke the camera lense and didn't feel like getting it fixed. I was going on vacation with my family, and wanted something I could take good photos with, while not breaking the bank. I haven't noticed any real drawbacks so far going from the Samsung to this phone. If you're a heavy gamer or someone that likes having the newest and greatest device, then obviously this isn't for you. I myself realized I'm not really using the high-end features I've been over paying for, so I'll probably be going for mid range phones from now on. This seems to be sufficient for social media, checking email, texting, watching videos, etc. Also, my vacation photos turned out great! As of now, I highly recommend this phone, I think it's a steal! If that changes, then I'll update my review.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I should start by saying that up until I got the 4a I was a repeat offender of the iPhone. I was ready to cut the cord and get an Android and I thought I was going to love my Pixel for the sheer fact that it wasn't an iPhone. I've had this since the week it came out (about 2 months now) and I regret this purchase immensely. The Pixel is really quirky, it stutters and lags with frustrating frequency when hitting buttons, often taking 2-3 seconds to ""think"" before executing the task you told it to (even if it's just to close a window). Beyond that, I constantly find myself clicking on things I didn’t intend to. It seems as if when making a swipe, like scrolling through a website, it lags for a split-second mid-swipe and reads it as if you’re clicking on whatever is under your thumb at the moment of the lag. This is extremely frustrating when you find yourself constantly clicking on ads accidentally, or unintentionally “liking” your ex-girlfriends Instagram post as you scroll through your feed (believe me, your excuse won’t be considered valid in the eyes of your current partner). It's interface is unintuitive, which I'll admit is partially a learning curve with the switch from Apple to Android. I hate to compare it to my iPhone 7 but that's all I know; simple things like vibration patterns, red notification dots on app icons, etc... that are standard on an iPhone are not standard options on Android. I understand that people want the opportunity to fully ""customize"" their phone, but I don't want to have to learn how to program macros to make my phone's vibrate setting less annoying. The camera that everyone raves about... it's just okay. Certainly better than the iPhone 7, but there's something artificial about it. Photo's make everything look almost like plastic and definitely not natural. Plus, the photo library is a maze of confusing folders. It requires navigating through 5-6 folders and sub-folders to attach a photo to a text from an SMS app. When you save a photo that is sent to you, you'd think it would go into your photo library but no, it goes into it's own ""messages"" subfolder that you'll have to dig for later. I'm sure there's a macro for that, but c'mon... Call volume is bipolar at best; it is either whisper-quiet even at full volume on speakerphone, or deafeningly loud. Even when my volume is at 0 (not an exaggeration, literally 0) the volume of the call is sometimes eardrum-bursting. It's inconsistent, you never know what you're going to get, and I'm almost scared to put the phone to my ear in fear of rupturing an ear-drum. The kicker for me, and the reason I finally decided to write this review, was earlier today when I started hearing voices come from my phone while it was not being used. Sitting at my desk doing work, with all apps closed, screen black, and faint voices start emitting from the phone like I was in a group-call. I don’t think I’m in need of a séance, but I also can’t explain that and it doesn’t make me feel comfortable about this phone in any way. I don’t want to sound entirely negative; the plastic casing that most people complain about doesn’t bug me. It makes the phone lightweight and, lets be honest, do you know ANYONE who doesn’t use a phone case? Even though the screen is mid-grade, it’s more than adequate and I’m glad that it has a headphone jack, even if it’s just for nostalgia and collecting pocket lint. At this point, I'm considering my $400 a loss. I know I’m in the minority here; all the “professional” phone reviews rave about this phone. But they only used it for a few hours, maybe a couple of days. This has been my personal experience, do what you want with it. As for me, I'm deactivating this phone and going back to my iPhone 7. This was a horrible experience and a regretful purchase.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"After being a firm Huawei phone user, I decided to get something different. I got my first pixel. I love it. It's not as camera friendly as a Huawei phone though. Huawei gives you more options like using a digital camera. But, it has lots of fantastic little features.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I had a pixel 3a for a long time. It’s now my toddlers. He drops it throws it spills food and drinks on it and it’s still in perfect working order. I’ve had the phone (4a)for less than six months. Power button stopped working last night and today it shut off fully charged and won’t charge won’t turn on. Google said I can bring it in to potentially be fixed free of charge if they determine there’s no damage. The only certified places to get it fixed are over an hour and a half away from my house. Not impressed with this phone. Would definitely not buy again. Will be switching back to iPhone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Great phone! Super!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I came from a Galaxy S8 which unfortunately had a quite badly damaged screen. Google has dropped the ball on a couple of what I consider crucial features (No separate ringtone and notification volume? Seriously?) but I have hopes they will rectify them in the coming updates. For the price, it is a nicely rugged phone that isn't a six sided piece of glass just waiting to shatter. The battery life is also insane! It lasts all day and then some with moderate use. I highly recommend looking into the Pixel series if you are fed up with Samsung.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Cons: - The Panorama mode is terrible. You can't go up and down, to take a photo of a tall tree, for example. - You cannot do a side scrolling panorama, for example, take a photo of a long shelf to see everything along the length of it. You MUST stay still and tilt for it to attempt a photo - The phone lags and glitches often when deleting a photo or switching from camera mode to video mode - Google Photos is the only app that comes installed for viewing/managing photos; there is no other image gallery Also - Google just updated app icons so they all look similar to each other and very different from what they were, making everything Google less accessible, more difficult to find. No settings to change app icons back to old version. No setting to change the battery icon to say percentage - hard to read the tiny battery symbol Pros - - regular camera is fine, night mode is cool I guess - not having bloat ware, having control over what apps I have or don't have is nice. No more NFL or Facebook stuck on my phone - phone speaker volume is very good for receiving calls Overall feeling pretty blah and annoyed with it. Maybe it would be better if they changed the camera related software. Is it too late to return this? Booooo thumbs down.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4a was my first new phone in years! It replaced an older phone, and the leap forward has been great. The battery lasts all day, even holding for a while when using the phone as a hotspot.

The Pixel 4a might not be the bleeding edge of technology, but it is very solid and totally worth the money.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"For 3 years I had been waiting for Motorola to come out with a suitable replacement for my old, cracked screen Moto G5 Plus. I waited in vain. All that were available in the US were gimmicky phones like the stylus. And they got ever larger too. The Pixel 4a is just right. It fits comfortably in my hand. It's feels lighter than my Moto. The on/off button is located high on the right side where it is out of the way -- I don't press it every time I pick up the phone. The fingerprint reader is located on the back where it can be operated one-handed, also out of the way so it is not triggered every time I touch the bottom of the screen. There is only an occasional problem with fingerprint recognition, not enough to complain about. I think they got the basic ergonomics right. The phone screen itself is bright enough to see outside. The calls are clear and volume is good. The screen is sharp. I have no problems getting a couple days regular usage from the battery. The processor feels fast -- I don't have to wait for apps to respond to input. All in all I'm very satisfied with this phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

My husband LOVES this phone! He finds new things that it does daily! This was the best Valentine's present I could have ever found for him!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Went from a pixel 2xl to a 3a to now the 4a. Pixels are clean no gimmick phones. The A series has everything you need and nothing you don't at a great price. I am a heavy user so I wish the battery was a bit bigger but that's my only complaint. I use it heavily for 10 to 11 hours a day and it still makes it through though. Would like it to last longer but I know I'm asking for a lot. This phone will be perfect if it came with a 4000 mah battery.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

Great camera! What else can I say for such a low price Excellent choice for a budget mobile phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I picked the 4A because of price. Great price point. It has done everything I need it to do. Battery life is great. I sometimes don't have to charge it but every other day. It is fast in loading apps. Reviews say some phones are faster because of processor. If they are then you're talking super fast. I'm not a tech geek so I wouldn't know. This one is great and I would recommend it. I swapped from another android phone and it only took me a day or so to get used to the small changes.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Not impressed just a regular phone I thought that since it was called the Google pixel it would be more surrounded around the photos app but it wasn’t so therefore I was disappointed because I was really looking forward to that,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4a represents exactly what every regular cellphone, to have a great phone that doesn't cost more than a PS5 or a computer. The best feature of this device is the software that is pure Android that's very easy to use and learn and the camera, which is the same as the main camera of the Pixel 4 & 4XL. There is no greater satisfaction to have a good budget phone that takes great pictures. This is the main reason I didn't go for the Oneplus Nord, because it incorporated many cameras that didn't took nice photos as the pixel even though it was pricier. In a nutshell, the Google Pixel 4a has a good software for the regular use if you don't overuse it for smartphone heavy games, a good battery that lasts me the whole day or even more, a 3 year software update warranty, and the amazing camera that comes with it!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Love the phone but the left speaker kinda sucks. Bit of a rattle when people are talking, seems they tried to get more base out of the driver than they can handle or their manufacturing process sucks and allows the driver to vibrate.

"I'm not a fan of this phone. Might return it, but what a hassle! It’s a good-looking and comfortable phone. Battery lasts for about 4-5 days. And it was much, much cheaper than other phones. (hmmm, wonder why?) First and most importantly, it constantly tell me I have no signal. I haven't moved, and have been with my carrier for many, many years, and this phone is the only phone that can't find the signal. Constantly. As in most of the time. Usage is not intuitive. It does many other very annoying things, and I can’t figure out how to make it stop doing the very annoying things. I went online for a user manual and the link sent me to a site to set up your new Pixel. Um, already done – where’s the user manual? There is no user manual – too bad, so sad. Also, a search of google, ironically, reaps no results on how to make the very annoying things stop. It is possible this phone is customizable, but you have to be a google master phone engineer to figure it out, and they’re sure as stuff not going to tell you. Bottom line for me was money. Calls generally work ok, as does text. But email? Holy C, you'd think I was asking it to do something easy! I have to slog through a full crap-load of automatic and unwanted questions (can’t answer the call without a question about contacts, can’t read a text without question about contacts, etc.) before I can do the common things. I do wonder if google even knows you can do that later IF you want to at all? So annoying! I also wish it had a home button as I'm forever accidentally calling people when swiping up which, as far as I have learned to date, appears to be the only way to get to the home screen and jumps right through contacts. Also have to go to home screen if I send an email because it kicks me out. If I want to read and respond to the next email, gotta start anew from the home screen. Stupid. Would not buy this phone again, although I think google could easily fix the operating system. I wonder if they ever will, though. Doubt it. Very disappointing.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"For the price, this phone rules. I don't know what the negative reviewers are talking about. It doesn't feel that cheap, the battery life is pretty good, and it's snappy and responsive. It even has a headphone jack. I have no problem with the embedded screen camera and I'm not sure how anyone would find it that bothersome - it's kind of cute. The only thing I find annoying is in the software not the hardware, I'd like to be able to disable right-edge back-swipe, for certain apps. But you can reduce the detection area. If you are going to be using it frequently outdoors the brightness gets high but only barely enough for acceptable viewing on a sunny day.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I went from a Galaxy S7 to this Pixel 4A 5 days ago. So far I like it. It is very similar to the S7 in overall size, but without the bezels the screen is bigger. Most functions seem similar, I'm not sure what the raves about a ""pure Android experience"" are about. I don't trust and don't use either the facial recognition or fingerprint reader, so I just gave them a middle star rating. The speakers are loud enough for me and I have a some age related hearing deficit. I've always used an ATT store to set up my phones before, but they told me they no longer do that for unlocked phones, despite paying upfront for their network for the past 8 years. I followed Google's online instructions for transferring the data from my S7 and they worked fine. The only irritating thing was that the directions said the box contained an adapter for attaching a USB C cable to a USB micro; it doesn't. It is an adapter for connecting a full size USB to the USB C in the box. So I had to go get a full size USB to USB Micro cable. Overall, I can't see a lot of difference between this phone and my previous S7, except that I now get security updates for Android and the S7 no longer does. Why pay $700+ for a ""flagship phone"" when this does the job for half the price or much less? And 5G? Give me a break. Lots of hype and no benefits so far. I don't expect to see a benefit in my rural area for many years and it still doesn't work any better than 4G LTE in downtown Denver where my wife's office is. So, a middle of the line phone works very well and this was the best I could find for my purposes.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I purchased the phone based on online reviews by pundits and users. The camera was rated great - check, all day battery life - check, great screen - check, Android without the bloatware - check. Everything was great except it didn't fit my big hands. It felt awkward and too small for me to hold until I received the phone case I ordered later than the phone purchase. Adding the phone case made holding the phone acceptable, however, there was still one thing I missed that I had on my last phone and that is a larger screen. I'm 60 and now need to use reading glasses so a larger screen on my aging eyes is a definite must for me. If you have smaller hands and don't mind a small screen this is a great device. And if you have big hands then it may not fit for you. My suggestion is to go to the store and hold a Pixel a4 or a phone the same size to see if it feels okay in your hand. If it fits then you can't go wrong with this phone. With that said I am sad to say that I returned it for a Samsung A71 which has a much larger screen and is rated great also.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

This might be because the adaptive battery feature needs to learn more about my usage. -Auto Rotation is not as good as the iPhone. It takes longer to auto rotate.

"Video call imagery is awful when using the front facing camera. Worse than my three year old Motorola phone. The video calls are pixelated and looks washed out. It is distracting how fuzzy it looks. I'm shocked that none of the reviews that I read prior to buying the phone mentions this. I did a quick search and tons of people have had this issue. The camera itself is fine and clear when taking photos so this leads me to think it's a software issue. I tried video calls using the built in calling app, Duo, Google Hangouts, Signal, Jitsi, and Line, all were the same blurry mess. The only app where video call was clear for me was Facebook Messenger. Guidance by support is to clean camera lens and factory reset the phone...the brand new phone I got a few days ago.

"I bought this to replace an older iPhone. I was a bit worried about transferring all my information from one opening system to the other but, using the provided cable, it was effortless and took just a few minutes. I’m finding the controls and settings to be easy to operate. The only complaint I have is the buttons are set too low on the right edge and hard to avoid when holding the phone. Minor problem. I picked this phone because of the excellent camera and the good price. I’m very happy with it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"*If you don't want to read my entire review, here is the summary: The Google Pixel 4a is the BEST phone you can buy right now for almost everyone. For $349 it's a NO BRAINER.* I have used several Android phones (including flagship ones that cost $900+) and I've also used an iPhone. But this Pixel 4a is the absolute best overall experience I've ever had with any phone. I'm a tech guy for a living, so I needed a phone that could do everything and do it well, this phone more than delivered! Did I mention it's ONLY $349? Below is a pros and cons list I've made for potential buyers. I hope you find it helpful! Pros: Fully unlocked so it will work with EVERY SINGLE carrier in the USA (As well as many outside the US), HUGE amount of built in storage of 128GB, plenty of RAM at 6GB, a fast and energy efficient processor (SD 730G), a bright and beautiful 5.8 inch display (OLED at 1080p+ resolution), a headphone jack! (For those of us who still prefer a wired connection), a decent sized battery (3100+ mah) that gives you all day battery with moderate to heavy use, fast charging included in the box (18W) you get from empty to 100% in about an hour and a half, with close to 50% after 20 mins give or take, dual stereo speakers that sound great, a very good hapitic feedback engine when you type, a phenomenal front and rear camera (literally the best camera on any Android phone), really premium feeling polycarbonate (plastic) body, really sturdy and clicky buttons, and the absolute best software experience by Google with at least 3 major Android OS upgrades in the future. Cons: No water or dust proofing, no wireless charging, only available in Just Black color, no 5G support, limited case selection (As of right now but that will change in the future). Overall, the experience of using this phone is fast, fluid, and enjoyable. The screen is bright and almost edge to edge, it's the perfect size for one handed use, the Pixel version of Android is light and easy to use and has many really good exclusive features like ""Now playing"" and ""Live transcribe"" as well as many more new features to come with the newest version of Android and security patches being pushed out directly from Google to their Pixel line of phones. It offers unmatched support and longevity for Android updates and security patches. I've had this phone for several days and it's my daily driver, I have had no issues or complaints with it at all. The battery life is great, it's super fast and smooth, it doesn't slow down or stutter when I use multiple apps at a time, it doesn't close my apps down in the background too quickly, and it's the perfect size for my hands and pockets. What else can I say? You don't need to spend $900+ to get a really good phone! Just spend $349 and get this phone! You won't regret it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Got a new phone and battery started to swell when charged once.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Charging port was loose when it arrived. It worked great for about two days, but now it's almost impossible to charge. Recommend purchasing from a different supplier.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
SOLD... I'm Pixel owner for LIFE!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was using the Pixel 3 previously. Processing power-wise it was a down grade but bought this phone because my pixel 3 was starting to stutter at times and I just loved the way the display on the Pixel 4a looked. After receiving the phone - the phone felt really nice on the hands: outer plastic shell didn't feel cheap nor plasticky as many youtube reviewers stated(feels solid to me atleast). Also the curvature of the side well complimented the gesture navigation(going back gesture). - full display mode on youtube is awesome as expected(the bottom left punch hole is rarely noticeable due to its position in horizontal mode). Although the space between the top edge of the display and the status bar is quite noticable and would've been better if the gap was shorter. - also the display brightness seems slightly lower than the pixel 3 but nothing serious. - haptics feels identical to the Pixel 3 and happy that google did not cheap on this part. - apps not supporting the display ratio/size has a slim cutoff on the bottom of the display. Also, the status bar part is unutilised on all apps, which is a bummer but again not critical. - photo takes a split second more to process/save right after taking one, but besides this occasion I don't feel any noticeable processing speed difference on daily tasks compared to the Pixel 3(probably gaming will feel materially different but personally I don't game with my phone so no complaints on processing power). Overall, really enjoying the display and the design.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Really a great phone for most people ! It doesn't have the most features in the world, but almost everything you really need. Great camera and fast in the apps. Battery life got better after 2 weeks when the phone get to know your usage patterns on apps. The battery last about 6-7 hours on screen on time if you use it mostly indoors with wifi and less brightness than you would be needing outdoors. -Minus: For no water resistance and no wireless charging, but for the price it is ok and understandable.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Unbelievable value and quality for the money! I've had it for 7 weeks now. I miss a few features that my Samsung Galaxy S6 had, like the voice activated camera shutter and the Gallery. All in all one dandy phone. I would have had to spend twice the money to get an appreciably better phone. Be sure to buy a Spigen armor model ACS01015 when you buy this phone. You won't regret it. The phone IS remarkably usable without a case.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I had a pixel 3a that started having too many issues to have it be worth holding onto (charge port, screen, etc) and figured the 4a would be a good upgrade. I was wrong on that. The phone itself seems great on the surface - fast SOC, no bloatware, that prized Google camera software, android updates for years to come...what could go wrong? Pretty much everything. I bought the phone through Best Buy, and right out of the box the thing was creaky. I couldn't press the power button or adjust volume without the thing making noises. No big deal, I thought, so I ran back to the store and managed to get an exchange. Unit number 2 had the same exact issue but worse. I had to go back, yet again, and get a third phone. All in one day. Guess what? This one is creaky too. If I wanted to hear that 24/7 I would have bought a house built in 1890. Whatever plastic they used to make the 3a is long gone, this thing feels like a cheap toy in comparison. The screen is good, but at what cost? A chunk in the corner is dedicated to the camera. Gross. Software? You would think that something designed by the company that makes the software and OS would have a handle on things. Ha. I have to reset the phone almost daily because apps will auto-crash upon opening them. I do not install that many apps on my phone - I've installed a grand total of 4. But it's nice, I'm sure it's a feature. I bet that Google added that on purpose in hopes of reducing screen time. It's wonderful when I need to check something in a pinch. I sold it at a huge loss. Guess what? The person I sold the three day old phone for 200 dollars sold it to someone else after a day. The cycle continues. Do yourself a favour and skip this one unless you like wasting money. I'd even get an iPhone SE (1st gen) over this piece of junk.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I've been looking for a new cell phone to replace my beloved Huawei Mate 10 Pro that I've had since September 2018. The Pixel 5 didn't grab me, Samsung has too much bloatware and the Sony Xperia 1 II just wasn't right--I'm waiting to see if Sony can pull it off with their next flagship (or just maybe the Pixel 6 will get it right). In the mean time--the Pixel 4a is the way to go until these cell phone makers can get it together and give as a ""dream phone."" For $350 you can't go wrong and it is a pure Android experience, no junk, no preinstalled Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, etc., etc. People talk about the processor speed but this phone is fast without all the junk running in the background that you'll find on other phones. The pictures show the 4a decked out in a Poetic Case and EGV tempered glass screen protector--all available on Amazon and all are perfect fits for the 4a. Bottom line: Buy it!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is a great phone. I moved from an Essential PH-1 because of a few issues there. I was afraid I'd miss the nicer materials, but that's simply not the case. Everything here is fast and solid. The screen is great. The sensors are fast. The battery lasts longer than all day. So good!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I purchased this phone for my husband for Christmas. He likes the phone a lot and has not had any issues with it. It takes great photos, gets updated more frequently and holds a charge for a lot longer.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I like it, it's fast",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"When taking photos when walking around, the location of the first photo is used for subsequent photos. One of the main reasons I purchased this phone was for photo field data collection. To work around this issue I purchased an app, Ultimate GPS Logger, for geotagging my photos in Lightroom later. If the issue gets resolved I will update my review.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Upgraded from a Pixel XL. For 350.00, you are getting a great deal if you are an Android/Google fan. Huge upgrades and the full face screen is just a nice upgrade. Battery life is perfect and camera take the signature Pixel quality. I wanted to wait for 5g but circumstance forced me for the 4g. I don't rely on data as much since I have wireless access wherever I go so if 5g is something you need then get the 5g version. If you are budget minded and don't care then this is a no brainer purchase.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"More than I expected, just $350?. Pixel person forever",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The only thing may be negative I see is the gently yellowish screen.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This was a great investment. It's very simple and to the point. I kan use it without the worry of it lagging and it's use is pretty straight forward. A definite recommendation.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"This phone was previously owned by someone and it got blocked by Sprint. As a result, I could not activate this phone with Sprint; it is BLOCKED, because someone still owes Sprint $ for this phone. How is this possible?? Why are Amazon/Google selling phones that cannot be activated under the guise of new and UNLOCKED phone? I am returning it... Wasted a lot of time ordering, returning, and trouble-shooting with Sprint on the phone until the Sprint rep was able to figure out WHY the phone cannot be activated. This is NOT acceptable.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The phone was great. Fast. Small. Good construction. Did not work on Pure Talk data.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This is a great phone. Easy to use and we'll thought out. Last phone was a Galaxy and this is definitely a step up.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Best phone on the market. Perfect size and features for the general user. Feels like an iPhone for build quality. Internal speakers are clear and sound quality. Couldn't ask for a better value.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Super Google phone!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Got this as a gift for my dad and he is really happy with it. His favorite thing about it is the camera,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Hello Reader, First of all, I would like to clarify one thing, I bought Google Pixel 4a for one reason and one reason only, which is: To flash and try GrapheneOS and CalyxOS on Google Pixel 4a So, If you are looking for any Android phone, please think twice before buying Google Pixel 4a. I placed the order on ""Feb 4th 2021"", and I received it on ""Feb 7th 2021"", I live in Bahrain and the phone sold by ""Triplenet Pricing INC"" in USA, That was really impressive to get the phone in just two days. Pros: 1- Very good speaker sound, for a small phone. 2- good screen resolution and touch. 3- good reception for carrier signal. 4- Only Google Apps installed by default. 5- ironically, Google Pixel devices meet the stringent privacy and security standards, that is why it's supported by GraphenOS and CalyxOS Cons: 1- I consider it expensive for its HW specs, there are other good brands in the market with higher specs with same or less price with really good feel and touch and good chassis, for example: OnePlus 7. 2- the phone edges have air pockets, you feel it and hear sound when you softly press on the edges, the body is polycarbonate unibody, what do you expect. 3- Forget to use the phone without an armor case and screen protector, you will lose it very quickly if you did not. Conclusion: If you are just looking for an android phone and you do not care about the brand, think twice before you buy Google Pixel 4a, you can find a better phone with same or lees price. Buy Google Pixel 4a only if you really want to, and you have your own reasons to do that, as I do.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Okay, I'm switching from a Redmi note 8 pro to the google pixel 4a. I have mixed feelings about this device. I'll get to the picture part at the end. This device is small. Iphone 6s is about the same size both in length and width. It feels super cheap. Like a prepaid phone that costs $80 dollars at your local walgreens. The interface is not snappy and quick like the YouTube reviewers say it is. It is average. My budget Redmi note 8 pro costs 200 dollars less than this device and it's a better experience. I found the fingerprint reader doesn't always work, when it works it feels like ages to actually unlock. The same thing with entering a pin. It feels like it takes a long time to actually unlock. Who is this phone for? Someone who isn't really on a phone all the time, it's not a powerhouse scrolling Instagram is okay YouTube is okay, the small display is just a let down. I don't know what model the youtubers are showing you because this device is small. Like really small. Like this would be fine for a child. Okay the camera. Beautiful pictures in good light, okay pictures in really low light, now comes the bad part about the camera. In areas that have light but it's not dark enough for night mode the pictures come out noisy and grainy. Like indoors at 4 pm. For $350 I strongly recommend a Xiaomi device. Or step up to the google pixel 5.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This phone is literally the best phone I have ever had. Exceedingly amazing in every way. The camera is superb,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The case fits like a glove and provides good grip. Excellent for the price!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is absolutely perfect. I used to have an iPhone until I got the 3a last year. I was hooked. Now they took what made the 3a amazing and perfected the it this time with the full screen display. Impressed with how Google focused on the important things like camera, smart OS, headphone jack, buttery smooth functionality, finger sensor, and simplicity. Plus its really smart. Satisfied with how they mastered the necessary things and dropped the frivolous features like wireless charging, waterproof, face ID and glass body on the 4a. The camera alone is worth $350. Seriously, go watch reviews. It is absolutely mind-blowing how great this phone is for the price. I highly recommend it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This phone is amazing,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Perfect little phone and an AMAZING camera.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is pretty good overall. I don't like that you can't assign different notifications sounds or ringtones to different contacts. There's also no notification light. Speed is good and so is the camera. However the screen was cracked within two weeks. Other phones I've had have taken far more abuse and never cracked. This was a drop of about 1 foot. It was in a case. You could blame the case for not being very protective. But what really bothers me is that it can't be repaired. At least I've not been able to find a cell repair place that's able to work on this phone. For the price it's a good deal, but I wish they would have installed a more durable screen.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"40 years old and I've had a smart phone since my palm treo. Many models, needless to say. While it lacks the fit and finish of higher end models, it gives you everything the casual user wants. Updates, camera, price point, and speed. You can't beat it for value.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have the original Pixel XL and almost upgraded to the 3a XL last year, but the reviews didn't convince me it was worth it. I just kept using my phone until I found what I thought would be a nice upgrade. The 4a is the right phone for me at the right time. The cost was so tempting given the specs, I didn't blink. I got it from Amazon only 3 days after official release. I love it. Nothing about it feels inferior to the Pixel XL. I was able to connect a USB-C cable and transfer my files and settings in about 20 minutes. I also connected to my main Win 10 machine and updated my music on the new phone and everything went without a hitch. I found this upgrade process so much easier and smoother than when I upgraded the two family I-phones (6+ and 7+ to 11) Christmas 2019. Once I set everything up I checked performance and found the new 4a very snappy. My use is mostly web browsing, email. news, a bit of shopping and Facebook. Nothing challenging, so I loaded up YouTube TV and watched it in small and full screen while I transferred some of the music files. I saw no slow downs in playback or the transfer. From my limited testing around the home office, the camera is pretty nice. The speakers are about on par with the original Pixel and about what I expected. The speakers sound fine. With a headphone jack and Bluetooth 5.0, better sound is simple enough to remedy. I know this isn't in depth or a long term review, but in the 24 hours I have had this phone its been great. I have gotten good battery life too. Thanks Google for a great phone and Amazon for getting it to me.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Good battery life. Mine came without a power brick though. Unfortunately I had it sent to my house then shipped to an APO. I’m beyond the point of being able to do anything about it. Oh well. I love the phone. Great for overseas. This way I don’t have to put my iPhone on a cell network I don’t trust.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4a would be a good phone, if Google didn't forget to finish programming the vibrate function. It cannot be set to switch between only ring and only vibrate, instead the only options are to always vibrate or never vibrate. For many people vibrate only is needed for places like work, or a movie theater, but there is no desire for it to also vibrate across a night stand while at home. Sadly, the Pixel 4a cannot operate the vibrate function in this fashion, and Google refuses to admit the problem or promise a fix. In the end, it makes the entire phone unusable. What a shame.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was really enjoying the Pixel 4a. The look and use of the Pixel 4a is great but unfortunately this is the least durable phone I have ever owned. My Pixel 4a had a 1 ft drop on to a wood floor that resulted in cracks on the screen. I have had previous phones fall from greater heights with no or only minor damage. While I loved the phone, unless the durability of the Pixel phones improve I will not be sticking with the Pixels.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Fingerprint is fast. Great phone; does the job at a great price.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The software is great, fast, and reliable. But, honestly the hardware is just average. There should be multiple cameras on any new phone at this price range this year. The processor is a not top of the line either and the battery life is fine, but nothing outstanding. You're buying this phone to get access to a Pixel phone that works well. It checks all those boxes. The camera quality is excellent, possibly the best single camera around. But, as soon as you look around at the competition globally, this is severely underwhelming. The phone feels outdated already and it's new. Add to that that Google doesn't give you perks like original quality uploads to Google Photos anymore and they don't include facial recognition, it just feels like they aren't trying hard enough. The phone is otherwise great, works well, runs smoothly, and doesn't have any issues or annoyances. And some of the software features are wonderful, like automatically recognizing songs without having to open an app.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Nice features for a phone that gets the latest version of Android OS. Can't beat the price vs features for this phone at this time.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Overall, this phone is very unintuitive. There's no back button so it uses the screen edges, you'll constantly find yourself going Back when you're just scrolling around. You have to swipe up from the bottom to check your apps, you also have to swipe up to check recent apps, besides these 2 instances fighting each other, the phone likes to ignore your swipe as well The phone is also very slippery but cases are hard to find. Like most phones, this one bugs right the hell out when exposed to rain. The pros, call screening and night photos are actually great. Overall I do not recommend buying this phone. If you have been disrespected by samsung or apple, try an LG or a 1 plus. Google is not as intuitive with it's own software as you might think.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"No user manual, not in the box, not online. It seems the only available information is on Google's Pixel Phone Help web page and on the phone itself. Both assume I know enough about what I don't know to search for it. According to one post, the rationale for limiting user information to online help is the rapid pace of change. That's what versioning is for: new release, new version of the manual. It's no more difficult than updating online help. Both formats are useful; each serves a different purpose. I may be wrong, but I suspect the company's refusal to produce a user manual is evidence of the disdain with which Google engineers view their user community. The attitude is not uncommon among software developers. I know whereof I speak; I am a software developer, though not for Google. And, yes, I returned the phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This phone is extremely comfortable to hold! I like everything about it except for Xfinity users not having good voicemail app. I highly recommend this device!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Love this phone. It takes great pictures and is the most affordable of the ""good"" phones. Problem is the battery life is terrible.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"First off the price seems a little steep. But it takes great photos. I would like it to notify me that I have a text message by touch. My old phone had a vibrate when I touched it to see if anyone texted me while I was somewhere else in the house, versus actually going into the phone and looking at the message icon for the dot.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"If you are not using this for YouTube, etc it really last for days without a charge very crazy!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pros: -high pixel density display -Google account management/no Apple ID bs -Fingerprint reader faster than iPhone 7 Cons: -utterly insane quantity of ads. What you are buying here is the right to use Google services directly, with no hope of avoiding their highest possible quantity of ads, short of rooting the phone, which obviously compromises security. Above all else, this is an advertising device, and it should be free of initial cost for that reason. Google makes 80% of their revenue from ads. I assume 80% of that 80% is directly sucked from the bloodstream of the 1,500 sorry sods that own this phone. -Camera is bad. Blurry image quality (think iPhone 4-5) and the worst focus / light balance / color balance of any phone I've ever used. -full Google bloatware suite -touchscreen constantly registers false touches, which renders multiple functionality completely inaccessible for >50% of the time, including pinch-zooming and typing. It's a well known problem. Google knows about it, but has never commented. We know they know, because if you look this problem up on the Google support forum, you'll find many threads where people start discussing the problem, and the thread is locked as soon as forum admins find it. Many people say it's because of the low quality of display - the display of the Pixel 4a will often have glue leak onto the toushcreen, which is kind of like having someone put their finger on your screen about half the time. -Screen sucks. Despite high pixel density and good actual screen image, the screen sucks. It has an incredibly thin glass panel that breaks at the slightest shock. Drop it from waist level and watch it turn into a safety hazard quickly. -Short battery life, always dead by the end of the day if I don't charge it, and I don't use my phone frequently or watch videos often. I hate this thing. Truly the worst phone I have ever used, it makes me pine for my ad-free Cricket flip phone experience. Amazon already deleted this review once, I assume because a Google admin found my review and reported me. If you're reading this... take your $450 and go buy a refurbished iPhone. Don't buy this piece of garbage ad revenue harvester masquerading as a phone. As of 2021, Google gets >80% of revenue from advertising. If you'd like to know how that's possible in a world of adblockers, buy this phone. ~4-5 ads per 10 minute youtube video. Not kidding.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Great, responsive phone but it keeps plummeting! Keep it on a rough surface so it doesn't walk off on you! Not sure what is going on but I keep finding this phone on the floor. A few times I've actually caught it in the act, just slipping off a surface that I've laid it on, so I've started to put it inside a box or other lipped surface to keep it from walking off. I suspect the screen and slight lip might be enough to reduce the friction so that even small vibrations can send it off in some direction but I've never caught anything actually doing it, and I didn't have the problem with my old phone (maybe it liked me more?) It's a cute source of jokes in my house. I've had the phone for about a week and a half and so far am liking it a lot. Pros: Nice weight, good responsiveness Cons: Misinterprets light touches, turns off while looking at it. The cons might be something I just need to hunt down settings for. It seems to be over sensitive when I try to swipe. It's often drilling down to the next screen when I don't want it to. It has also shut the screen off during a few tasks, so it is a lot different than my previous phone. That being said, it has the features that I like and is wonderfully nice and responsive, even if it does like skydiving a bit too much.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"As someone who has always only been on the snapdragon 600 line series (I'm extremely cheap and poor both ok!) due to the below 200 price point, this phone is an absolute godsend. I had no idea how much of a different 6gb ram and a 730g could make over moto power g (2020) specs. Had initially bought a renewed one and had to return it due to a sim tray missing (how'd amazon refurbished miss this!!), a warm screen and phone getting hot. tbh, i realized the screen wasn't a defect and just how google intended :( Was actually plannign to return this too but recently I've been returning too many items partially due to losing my savings and miscell reasons here and there. I didn't realize the return policy wasn't intended to be used for try and buy purposes so I am scared of being flagged for too much activity so I'll have to jsut use this :( . Anyways! on to the phone! Like i said, I've only just started using it despite holding it for a week cus i was scared of it getting damage or antyhing. I'm starting to get used to the warm display (samsung, OP and moto users bewarned!) and THANK GOD the phone heating up was a renewed phone issue. phone is snappy as well and while i have a few issues with android 11, thy're nothing to do with the phonne's hardware.

For the price, the value for money it provides is really unparalleled. There's nothing better you can get in this price range in the market. Anyone who wants to spend less and wants a great phone, this is what you should buy. WHATS IN THE BOX Phone, Charging brick and cable, USB to USB type C adapter, SIM ejection tool and some paperwork MY THOUGHTS It cannot be compared to the mighty expensive phones - the iPhones and the high end Galaxy S phones. They are more than double or triple the price of this phone but do provide double or triple features as compared to this phone? The answer is NO. Let me elaborate. CAMERA: Writing about Camera first as that's the most striking feature about this phone. In one word, the camera is awesome and super convenient. It is arguably the best phone camera for still photography in the world. Pictures are crisp and clear, with great detail, vivid colors which are very close to being natural and great dynamic range. Also must add that the camera so is super easy to use. I love it for it's simplicity. You can pull it out and start clicking photos rightaway. It has fast focus which makes it a great point and shoot device. And what about night photography, it's just awesome, even in the lowest of light, it can capture great detail. The photos aren't grainy at all. A couple of photos of my kitchen garden are attached as a sample, taken in pitch darkness. It also has an astrophotography mode but yet to use it. The front facing camera is also great. The picture quality is excellent and the bokeh effect also works very well for portrait shots. In fact would say that this phone captures perhaps the best bokeh shots without using a telephoto lens. Both the back and the front camera are excellent in this regard SOFTWARE: it is pure Android. Out of the box, it came with Android 10. And just this morning when I checked, Android 11 was available for download. Which phone company will give you latest software updates so regularly (except Apple). Plus google has promised to provide software updates for at least 3 years for all their devices. Samsung announced very recently that they would support their devices for 3 years with software updates but we all know that the updates will be slow to come by. At the end of it, there's nothing better than pure Android. BATTERY LIFE & CHARGING SPEED: In my observation, the battery life is quite good and easily lasts me a day of normal use. Some observations attached in pictures. There are two ways in which the battery life was observed - one without power saving option on (you can toggle it via the pull down menu) and one with the power saving option on. Without the power saving option, got the phone to last more than a day with almost 5 hours of screen on time. The ambient display was on and that took quite a bit of battery so you'd have to be careful with that. There's also the always on display but it will certainly hog battery life. With the power saving option on, got the phone to last a little less than 2 days with 5 hours on screen on time. This is great. I am sure that with Android 11 now coming, the battery life will only improve even more. The advertised battery capacity is 3140 mAh. The box includes a wall charger which is 18W. It's not as fast as some of the other premium phones but good enough for me. I wish wireless charging was present even at a slower speed but not a big deal. BUILD QUALITY: yes the back of the phone is plastic but still it is sleek and has a very decent build for the price. The weight is nicely and evenly distributed and it doesn't feel cheap at all. It quite light actually which is good as well. It doesn't feel as premium as a glass back phone but still very close. In any case, most people would put a cover on this so who cares if it's plastic or a glass back. Also, plastic provides better durability as glass is more prone to cracking. You can actually use it without the case but with an edge to edge glass screen protector. HEADPHONE JACK: Yes, there's a headphone jack at the top of the phone. And its a moment to rejoice as most of the known brands these days don't have a headphone jack. To me it is super convenient as all my wired headsets work so well with this. With other phones either have to use an Adapter or a blue tooth device which is also ok but nothing replaces a 3.5 mm headphone jack. You can quickly plug in your high impedance headset and enjoy listening to music. DUAL STEREO SPEAKER SYSTEM: This is one of the features which is found mostly in more premium phones. And this phone has it. It has a speaker at the top of the phone and another one is on the edge which is bottom firing. Overall it creates a good effect when watching youtube videos. SCREEN SIZE: The screen size is 5.8 in which is small when compared to other large phones. But to be honest, its quite ok. It has a punch hole front facing camera but very good decision to keep it in the corner rather than the center. Keeping it in the corner make the view rather unobtrusive while watching videos or photos. SCREEN QUALITY: the screen is AMOLED which is always preferable over LCD panels. It has deep blacks, good contrast and viewing angles. Mind you it's not the highest quality OLED panel and you can tell it when you compare it with high end Samsung phones. But again for the price, it is quite good. It is 1080p screen which is more than enough for day to day use. One observation here is that even indoors, the phone doesn't feel bright enough, it has to be kept at 75-80% brightness to be able to use it comfortably. For Samsung phones, keeping the phones at 40-45% brightness suffices. PERFORMANCE, RAM & MEMORY: The phone is powered by a mid-range snapdragon processor. It's an octacore 730G processor which is certainly not the best but more than good enough for day to day tasks of browsing the internet, news apps, watching youtube videos, playing some low end games. You can actually play some high end games as well but the performance was just about ok. The G in the processor name conveys that it provides improved graphics. But do see some frames dropping here and there while graphically intense games. But it wasn't intrusive or distracting in any way. An occasional stutter here and there does happen but largely good. The phone comes with 6 GB of RAM which is more than enough for multi-tasking and keeping the apps in memory. Storage is 128 GB which I feel is more than good enough, you don't need anything more than that to be honest as Google provides free cloud storage at optimal image quality through Google photos. What's not there: following features are not there as compared to high end phones: no water proofing or IP rating, no glass back, no wireless charging, no face unlock, no in screen fingerprint scanner (it does have a fingerprint scanner on the back and it works very well), no telephoto lens, no wide angle camera, no expandable storage via microsd card. All of these are present in more premium phones but really do you need all of these bells and whistles. Perhaps wide angle camera is the only one I miss. In summary, this phone ticks all the boxes considering its price and you just can't go wrong with it. It's a lot of phone for the price.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Just received this phone. It is smaller than it is described, and it is not compatible with most universal charging cables. It does not come with a SIM CARD to Activate this phone it will port your information from your current phone to this one but it wont activate unless you purchase one online or at the Sprint/T-mobile Store. We made and appointment and it did not take long to activate. The phone is fast and has tutorials to learn to navigate the phone. It will take a little time to get use to as it is not like the S 6789 10 series. The other negative is it doesnt fit with any covers so have ordered 3 different types and hoping the 3rd one fits. Jury still out on this cell!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Best phone of 2020,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Don't be fooled by its low price, $349 will get you one of the best Android experiences available there. Sure, you may not get things like wireless charging or water resistance but how much do you really need that? What you want is a fast phone, supported by a long time and with a great camera. And this has all of that!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Coming from a Pixel XL v.1, this screen is actually smaller. The measurement corner to corner is not the best way, IMHO, as most companies make the phones taller to increase reported screen size. If there was a 4a XL, that would be nice, but will have to wait for the 4a 5g to see what the dimensions really are. Yes, for me, the extra money for larger XL size and 5g will be well spent.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Just what I needed. Good phone for a low price.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Phone stopped working after first charge. The battery got charged but for some reason it wouldn't load up completely. I wanted to like this phone but I had to return it. Maybe I received a lemon but I've been put off enough to where I don't want to take a chance on another Pixel. They do software well but for hardware I think I'm going to stick with one of the conventional manufacturers.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
No doubt in my mind like the product.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great camera! Plastic body makes the phone thin and light.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"except for hardcore gaming or people who need blazing performance or want the absolute best screen (with high refresh rate), this phone does it all and has a better camera than anything in its price range. can't go wrong with it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Is a google phone, for the best price, the only minor problem is the battery life but I don't care, the google experience is the best for an android environment",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I haven't bought a phone since my Samsung S5 Active, so I must admit to a little shock with this phone. It is so fast! I couldn't give a good review of the facial recognition as I haven't used it yet. After I have tried it and taken some pictures I will add to my review.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I needed a new phone. I liked my pixel 3a so I got the pixel 4.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"While the phone seemed awesome at first use I have had it for just over a month and I am now spending another $150 bucks to replace the screen? WTF! They claim it has water damage but I spent the money to buy a premium case and in general, take care to keep it well away from water so this phone when from being a deal to being a waste of money. If a phone can not withstand some humidity or a slightly damp finger what is it really even worth? I am not saying it should be able to handle being dunked into a glass of water but a damp finger waking up my phone to check a recipe shouldn't cost me $150 bucks every few months. Save your money do not buy get something that can handle the basics of life.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Camera is one of the best out there. Speakers sound better than any phone I've had since the nexus 6p. AMOLED display and 128gb storage at this price is great. ""Budget"" processor is fast enough, phone hasn't seemed slow in any regular scenario. Battery life is decent, can make it a full day no problem. Only gripe is it comes set to gesture controls out the box and the ""back"" gesture is always conflicting with app's right swipe. Had to revert to 3 button interface.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Overall I WAS very pleased with my device, until the fingerprint reader stopped working in one day. Google recommended I take it to ubreakifix to have it repaired under warranty. I did this but two days after receiving it back I picked it up from charging and the screen came off. I took it back to the repair shop who insisted they had to wipe the device in order to fix the SCREEN. It takes hours to switch devices due to some unique apps I have , so I contacted Google about getting an advanced replacement. They said twice that they would do it, but each time failed to follow through saying they couldn't get it done because I hadn't bought it from the Google store. If you don't have any hardware issues you will likely be happy with the device. If you do don't count on Google to do much for you.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Phone is great but the speakers were fuzzy and distorted. I think I just got a bad one, awaiting my replacement.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Been using it for two months. Amazing for the cost.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great product at good price point.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Phone was broke in the first week, because of splashing water",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I always buy budget friendly phones, the Pixel 4a by far has exceeded my spectations. Great adaptive battery life, small size for better one hand operation, beautiful pictures, overall a great phone. I've never own any of the Pixel line phones before and I'm regretting not trying them sooner.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone, super fast and amazing camera quality!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought this to replace my 3 year old Pixel which won't hold a charge. It arrived quickly in great condition. Set-up was easy by simply swapping the SIM card from my old phone and using the cord to transfer data. Battery life is great so far and I have no complaints about the phone. One note is that is charging cord is about 6-8"" shorter than my old USB-C that came with my old pixel, so I'll be using the old one and buying a longer cord for charging at night.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Wonderful, previously had the 3a, the 4a is wonderful.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Exactly what I wanted after having the OnePlus 7 pro. Small is so nice and light. Everything works as it should. Excellent value.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I was so excited to get this less expensive Android phone with a fantastic camera, but I found that the screen was just too small to use as my primary smartphone several hours a day. In general the processor is only so-so fast, the screen is definitely crisp and clear, and the build of the phone is good enough for the price. The fingerprint reader works fine. Having the headphone jack is cool. But, at the end of the day, I needed a bigger screen for day-to-day use.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I switched from an iPhone and didn't know how I would like android, but was able to set all of it up and transfer my contacts and data easily! I am not the most tech savvy person, and even though I have had the phone for just a few days, it has been very user-friendly. The phone itself came in perfect condition; there were no scratches, everything was packaged pristinely, and I have absolutely no complaints!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Less than one month the display is falling. it is a common problem poor quality,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"So, i have always been an iphone user and decided to try my first android with pixel 4a. I know a lot of people might not do this but i put on white noise on my phone in the night. In a week, the phone speaker blew up and was heavily distorted. There is no reason this should happen. Tried every fix but nothing. NEVER had this issue with an iphone. How cheaply are the speakers made? Took it to a google store and then replaced the phone 3 times and had the same issue before returning this piece of junk. Wow google, just wow! If you do not believe me, try it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Lemme make this super easy for you, BUY IT!!! At 349 your dollar to value ratio is unmatchable. The cameras are unreal, the display is awesome, it runs stock Android, the size of the phone is just right and the icing has got to be the battery life, it's incredible. Sure it may not be made of prescious rare metals or have the strongest latest gorilla glass or be IP resistant, but it's 349! 349! You could destroy 3 of these and still have money left over for some Arby's versus destroying 1 of the many phones available on the market today. Do the favor, treat yourself. You'll be happy I insisted.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The phone is reasonably priced and does all the things a phone needs to do. I like the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone. The battery life is excellent and the phone charges quickly.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Phone worked great for a couple of months. But it has suddenly turned into a black screen paperweight.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"CONS: My main gripe is this phone feels like google is dropping beta on me as a user. Sometimes the phone answers phone calls from my doctors office that are recordings I need to hear, to only have google assistant in my phone cut it short. Google assistant in search of a place in my local area, I switch to map in the google assistant window. The map is broken when trying to move the map around, glitches and fails. I have to switch to maps to look for locations near me instead of google assistant. As for screen on auto rotate, the phone does not rotate automatically most of the time. These are simple software issues I deal with since day one. As for the physical hardware of the device I have no gripes other than a lack of ulrawide camera lens. PROS: Google photos cloud storage. Great main shooter for the standard 4:3 aspect ratio. Cpu is decent. Haptic feedback is great! Battery life is surprisingly good considering the battery size. The size is perfect for one hand use. The size for some could also be a con. I find it to be a nice balance. Stock android is much better than some, except Motorola.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I would give negative zero if I could expected better from the company that gave us Android,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I got my pixile 4a from Amazon, it's been about 2 weeks now, I have noticed, twice that there is some software issue, I tried opening an app it opened and closed back several times, on another time I tried opening an app but the screen was frozen, didnt respond. I both cases I had to restart the phone manually since even the restart on the screen was frozen. Hope it's just a software issue that can be fixed when google pushes out a newer software version. The rest is fine. I was previously using Huawei smart phone it's a slightly better phone than a pixile for almost the same price, changed because Huawei is no longer supported by many American companies including android and hoogle, so some apps stopped working. Has anyone had this Frozen screen issue.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Can't adjust notification volume separately from ringer volume.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is really good for what you are paying for. I love the size of this phone and the design. Performance is good too with most apps. But there are some disadvantages with this phone. First: Video calls, I use facebook messenger a lot for video calls, this phone gets extremely hot during video calls and cant even handle it for an hour. No Miracast protocol which means you cannot cast/screen mirror your phone to Roku/Smart TVs without their stupid device chromecast. Google disabled this feature for business purposes to sell chromecast, even though you can still hack your phone to do this, does not worth it. Otherwise this phone is good, charges fast, runs great, fingerprint great, great colors and display, good camera, I am giving 4 star to this phone because they made ""Apple move"" by disabling my favorite feature on this phone. And if I find same size phone, with similar features I would replace it, but not with Apple. If anyone know the same size phone similar price and similar specs please let me know.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Very good camera. This phone gives excellent value for the money spent,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone. Worth the price. Durable.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Just got back from the local Verizon store and they confirmed the phone is not configured to work on their LTE Advanced network. It will make out going calls but will not receive incoming calls and text messages take up to 5 minutes to be received.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Really like the 4a. The phone is compact but very slim bezels give you almost all screen. Battery life is excellent. The display is great. The processor is very capable - I have no issues with any of the apps I use. I've had wireless charging in the past but I charge at night so plugging in is no big deal. It goes all day and I have half the battery left when I go to bed.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Had this phone for about 24 hours so far and loving it. Simple to use just gotta get use to the change from my old phone. So far my only complaint is you can't add an sd card of you need or want to have more storage. Takes great pictures, has interesting ringtone's and notification options, and fingerprint scanner is pretty accurate. Will update a new review once the ""Honeymoon"" phase is past 😉😀",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It's plenty quick, a great form factor, and handles calls well. But the battery life is awful compared to my 3 year old OnePlus 5T. My old OnePlus can still go all day with plenty of screen time and still have 30% left by the time I go to bed, and I routinely used to get almost 2 days out of it back when the phone was new. But the Pixel 4a struggles to make it to the end of one full day even with brightness set much dimmer than the OnePlus. I would consider the 4a to be the absolute bare minimum battery life acceptable for a smartphone. I'm not commuting much anymore, but this feels like a phone that would have me stressing about making my commute home without an emergency battery pack. It's acceptable, but certainly not great.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is an excellent phone, with good display for the price, and with all good basic needs for a phone.. I bought this for my son, his first phone... It's great...Very good cameras, good battery life... Google's commitment with 3 years OS update make this phone worth buying....",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Love the phone except for very poor cell reception. My phone calls consistently are dropped. It's getting to be embarrassing. I've called my carrier, AT&T, gone in to their store to try to get help and so far nothing has worked to improve the reception.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Got directly from Google Fi. Having intermittent issues with GPS and compass while navigating in Google Maps, compared to my older Moto G5 Plus. Location History when taking it for a run is very choppy and missing big chunks of location data. Phone is otherwise very nice, but the GPS not being reliable is a showstopper. Battery life is pretty good and performance is snappy.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Great phone for the price!! Battery is not as good as they say... besides that I really love it! The camera is excellent!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I really wanted to like this phone. I anxiously waited 20 days to receive it just to be let down. BIG TIME. The touch responsiveness is VERY laggy. Forget typing actual words when texting. The keyboard lags and chooses the wrong letters. I wouldn't know how the camera is considering when it is opened it freezes the phone. The fingerprint unlock is slow. The battery life is so so. I'm not crazy about the weight of the phone, it feels very light almost like I'm holding a toy phone. I'm really disappointed. This is the first AND last Pixel phone I will own. Unfortunately I will have to keep it as I can't be bothered to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for a refund and searching for a new phone. I was excited for this phone as it was in my price range, so it's a big letdown..I should have just saved up the money for an S20",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Not very pleased with the pixel 4a. The back function is not ideal. All to often it closes the app or page instead of backing up just one screen. Can get frustrating when comparing items or info on the internet. The bluetooth will not connect to my vehicle. The phone says it cannot communicate with the car system. All my other phones have and still do. Looking on the pixel issues posted, other people are having similar issues. If I can't find a fix to connect, I may return as I'm not trading cars.. The wifi and network connection is fine, no problem s, speed of phone is acceptable. If it would only connect to kenwood car components it would be an acceptable phone. Handsfree driving is important to me.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great phone, fast ship",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It was a gift for my daughter and she loves it,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I love the size.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I was worried about buying a phone sight unseen especially since some reviewers got bricked phones. I got my pixel and had no problems getting it on my US cellular plan. Watched YouTube all day and only went to 50% battery. Never had to even use battery saver. I was worried about the smaller size but it's a non issue. Great screen resolution and takes great pictures for a phone. I turned off the finger print recognition because with a case on it's hard to get a good read. I turned off the gesture controls instead using the normal Android three button set up since they don't work well. For 350 bucks it's honestly the best phone you can get.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Needed a new phone since my four year old HTC was losing its flow. This pixel is really cool and works smoothly. It's not flagship but does everything you need if it's basic stuff like socials and watching vids. Would suggest grabbing a case as well. Camera is fabulous. For the price this is rare deal!!! If your on the fence on a budget phone then don't be this one is a gem.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I finally switched from Samsung and Motorola phones to a Pixel. I had read a lot of websites extolling how good of a price it was based on the features and decided to give it a chance. Overall, I would say that it is worth the money, but, having it for a few days now, there are some obvious pros and cons. Pros: Definitely the price 3 years of software support/upgrades Not full of bloatware Cons: The camera takes great pictures, but the software is lacking so every time that you take a picture and want to see it, you need to wait 5 seconds before the phone processes it. There is no wireless charging. There is no facial recognition. The sound was a real letdown. It is not nearly as loud and clear as similarly price phones. The screen is a bit small and the actual body of the phon doesn't seem as solid as I have come to expect from similar phones. I definitely think it's in the above average range based on the amount that you are paying. But, keep these cons in mind and add in that soon Google will be releasing the 5g versions which this one is not.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pro: Good battery life, compatible with all the carriers, smaller size makes it easy to carry. Stock android makes it fast and smooth. Cons: Smaller size means a smaller screen but if you aren't reading books or watching a lot of videos the screen size is fine. I am very happy with mine, would buy again.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Doesn't send text messages consistently. Pop out video doesn't work. Native video chat doesn't recognize phone orientation.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The ""Google Pixel 4a"" is super fast, and the 128 GB is the right mix of storage. This is such a significant upgrade from my last cell phone that got fried when I jumped in the pool with it, a little careless on my part, I will have to be more careful with this one. I've been using this new phone for almost a month, and I haven't had any problems. Like I wrote, it is super fast and can upload Apps in a matter of moments. Plus, if you are one for not spending a lot of dough on the phone, the cost is most fair for what you get at the end. This is a top of the line phone that is a noticeable improvement from my last one that I had help installing from a family member. Still, we got this phone running without a hitch. I would say you got to know what you are doing. Not saying anyone can do get it to run so quickly out of the box without help. Still, those are the breaks, just know if you are like me, and you do fry our phone, all is not lost if you do buy this one, and you will be somewhat better off in the end if everything goes well. Also, the battery life on this thing is a great plus as well.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Phone worked fine for 2 months. Now the microphone won't work. Can't make phone calls with no sound. After return time. Will not buy another phone from Amazon!!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Phone glitched after just 2 moths of use.... All black screen with error message saying the phone is corrupt and can't be used. Amazon and Google are refusing to replace it and I need to wait 2 weeks to send it in for repairs. Need this phone for work so will have to purchase a new phone to hold me over. Very disappointed. DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is literally everything I could ever want or need in a phone. I do not give two craps about multiple cameras or 90hz screens. The Pixel 4a is absolutely stunning for it's low price point. Double the storage than my last phone, a better camera, better screen, fantastic OS, updates for three years, free google photos storage.. and all for 50$ less than my previous phone! The camera is the selling point for me. It is just as good as the cameras on flagship phones, and it's only one camera. Google's software really seriously kicks ass. The touch screen is snappy and I don't find myself wishing it was faster, it responds immediately to touch, scrolls fast and looks vibrant. The screen to body ratio is perfect, really great job removing bezels. The hole punch is not at all irritating, I've had the phone about three weeks now and I am completely used to it. It blends in and works well with what is on the screen and there are plenty of wallpapers to suit it. It is much better than a notch of a bezel. It looks cool I think. The base storage being 128GBs is seriously nuts. My last phone I only got 64gbs, because in order to get the 128gb version it was $100 more! With 128gbs and free google storage, I can't imagine needing more space ever, really. I'm really enjoying the phone, it's nice to hold even with a case, it's lightweight and pleasant to view and type on. I don't imagine myself getting another phone for at least 5 years. It is an absolute powerhouse of a buy, highly recommend.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Initially the phone was exactly what I wanted. Used the phone for a few weeks then it got stuck in a reboot loop then software issues preventing me from backing up my info. So I contacted Amazon. because since the phone won't stay on long enough or I can't back up or erase my personal and important small business info from the phone I'm not comfortable sending it back.... Amazon won't issue me a refund without returning the phone. I'm not comfortable retuning the phone with my info and accounts open. I tried to explain this to several times to customer service and they told me to contact google. Called google from a different phone and Google customer service is closed because of covid restrictions. This is BS. So it's looking like I may be stuck with a $350 paperweight.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It is a pleasant phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"My wife's had this phone for 6 months now and really likes it. No bloatware, good battery life, likes the size because it easily fits in a pants pocket, and fairly fast considering the processor is less than other Pixels. She highly recommends, especially at this price.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have owned an original first generation pixel, a pixel 3 xl, and a pixel 4 (which i broke and replaced with this 4a). This is honestly the first pixel that I have been somewhat disappointed with, although the $350 price tag definitely tempers my disappointment. I use a liquid glass screen protector and the official Google fabric case and I honestly have zero real complaints about the build quality. The screen is great, the buttons are tactile and responsive, the fingerprint reader is amazing, and the camera is excellent as usual. Phone speakers kind of suck but who really cares. My big complaint is the software, it's often gummy and unresponsive. Apps will occasionally freeze, and sometimes touch screen controls become unresponsive or buggy while using an app. This doesn't happen very often, maybe once every week or two, but when it does happen it really pisses me off. I had problems like this happen for like a week on my pixel 3 xl before it was fixed with a software update. It's been a problem for like 6 months with my 4a and it still happens. All together though, if you're looking for a sub-$400 phone the 4a is probably pretty hard to beat, just be prepared for the phone to crash and require a restart maybe once every two weeks.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Very very good,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The touchscreen is flaky. I hope a software update fixes it, or that it's just my specific unit. It varies between annoying and frustrating. It's great otherwise though. Also the screen aspect ratio is wider than most YouTube videos and all HDTV so that's not so nice. The camera is perfect as usual with pixel phones.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Got rid of my Samsung Note 10 that was only a year old for the Pixel 4a. The Note 10 wouldn't charge and Samsung wouldn't fix without sending it back to the factory. It was a common problem with that phone. The Google Pixel does everything I need and very easy to use and set up. The price for it is awesome as well.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is a very good phone for the price. Does everything I want or need it to. Only two ""downsides"" I could complain about is that when playing some games the phone eats thru power and gets hot. And I miss the fingerprint reader.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4A is for sure waaay overrated! I have the Blu Vivo XL4 and much of the 4A is very similar to it! The one feature I hate on the my Blu is the call dialing UI. If an error is made in dialing it can't be corrected, you must start all over again! The 4a has the same exact dialing UI..Apps missing can't reinstall most, Screen is dim even at maximum brightness with high intensity with night light turned off! The 4A has a few improved features and a lot of bloat to disable and block tracking your activity. I was happy to get a new phone with better calling features only for this pixel 4a to have the same calling UI as the $150 Blu phone for $200 more! Ugh ugh. I was stunned! That was the one main thing I was anxious to get rid of!!! A major deal breaker!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Excellent mid-tier phone below a $400 price point. A phone by Google means no spyware/malware preinstalled on the device and immediate OS updates.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Traded up from a 4yo lg. The 4a processor is much faster. The camera takes good pics. Battery life is double the lg. The learning curve is steep. I do NOT like google for the simple reason that nothing is intuitive. If you don't know which icon to push, and in which order, you will be frustrated. But, it works as designed. I bought the clear silicon cover and 2pak of lens covers that applied cleanly without bubbles. The file transfer was remarkably drama-free. Just pop in your sim card, connect the cable back-to-back and follow the simple promos. Done.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"It's very disappointed! It's the second time I bought cellphone from Amazon, and will be the last time. It came with a used and even have scratch on the back of the phone. No charger and any accessories in the box. The box was unsealed! Very unacceptable for hundreds dollars New phone. I returned it right away. The first phone I bought from Amazon was defect and I returned it... Really lost faith about buying phone on Amazon.... Definitely won't try again!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"People online have said that the build is less premium. Everyone places a case and screen protector on their phones so how much does that really matter? -Pure Android experience - this is a big selling point -works awesome -good sized device, feels right - great camera - price is awesome, I've paid more for smartphones and didn't get a device of this calibur - sets the bar for Smartphones Go buy this Pixel 4a!!!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I had it for a week, it fell out of my pocket while I was sitting in a chair, and is already cracked. Easily the weakest screen I've ever had on a smartphone. This was the first time I ever dropped it, and it fell about 2 feet at best. I would not recommend buying, because the cheap quality of materials means the phone will not last long. My iPod touch screen from 2011 lasted longer than this thing.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
It's OK,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"worked fine for two weeks, then started charging problems, as soon as I plug, it is shutting down, and no matter how long it is plugged battery never goes over 28-29 percent. tried different cables different outlets but no help. btw while it works its a nice phone, great camera nice clean os.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Good phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"So I have had zero issues with the fingerprint reader. It is actually been really good for letting me in and nobody else in. I even put a case on mine and I can still reach the finger reader so I actually think it's really great it's much easier for me to get into my phone compared to my old one. What I like about this phone too is that it is thinner. I used to have the Moto x charge and that was definitely much wider and I didn't realize how much more uncomfortable it is. Now when I pick that one up to try and compare to this one it's such a beast in such a tank. Whereas this new phone it's thinner and slimmer and can actually like fit in my palm so it's in my hand and then it can sit nicely on my finger like if I'm holding it like cut. Which is very nice and I can reach everything on it with my thumb. The fact that the screen is the entire phone face is still giving me the exact same size as my old phone just I no longer have a big phone because it didn't take up the whole screen it had sides on it before so I really like that this one is the whole screen and that it's slimmer. I have a nice case on it and I have a screen protector on the front and I'm still able to use everything the same and everything is functioning fine. My only thing is yes the battery does last all day, my old phone my battery could last a couple days but it was an ex-charge and the battery was supposed to do that. But the bonus about this phone here is it does tell me if I keep continuing using it at the rate that I am it tells me about when my phone will die the estimated die time for the battery. So that's easy for me to be like oh okay well I'm going to be going and doing this so maybe I should charge it now. But I typically only charge it at night when I'm going to sleep. it does have a spam detection for calls which I didn't realize was a thing and I've had a couple phone calls like pop up but never ring and then they go away and I am notified that they were spam and then I have verified and they actually are indeed spam. So that has been really nice. I also like that I can give names to my group chats. Everything seems to be running very smoothly and fast at least faster than what I'm used to. it did take a little getting used to for me to do the back button cuz there was no back button I couldn't figure it out but if you just hold off to the side a little bit it is actually much easier to go back and forth between things I've found. my screen now has five icons across compared to my old one that had only four icons across so for me that's fine because I can see them fine I haven't looked to see if I can change that. So if you are maybe hard on seeing that might not be a benefit but otherwise for me since I don't have that problem this is great I really also like that I can just click on the time and date on the phone and it pulls up my calendar or the weather I don't have to go search for a different app I just click on it on my phone and it just takes me to that app. my other favorite thing is that it is still an Android phone I absolutely love the Android app I even have my tablets in Android because I'm just so used to Android and I prefer Android over the counterpart. Like I really dislike Apple and Apple I think is so much more expensive. another fun thing is the night mode I set a bedtime for me and when it's my bedtime if I'm staying up it goes into a black and white scale mode so everything is in black and white so then I go all right fine yep it's bedtime. I also like the do not disturb because I can have things blocked for when I'm sleeping so my phone isn't ringing or anything and I don't have to remember to put it on silent it was automatically does that. Unless of course it's emergency it is set to if somebody calls back within a 10-15 minute window that it will ring because it's a priority call and I have that turned on. I haven't even come close to using all the storage space that I have on my phone. Whereas my old phone I was constantly having to delete things to get a new app if I wanted to and it was very hard to do, so I like the extra space I like how fast it works and I like the thinness of it actually. As for phone calls and stuff I don't have an issue with the speaker or the earpiece very simple to use and my camera is still working nicely I I still get really nice pictures. this one does say that it's for all carriers and I have Xfinity mobile, and when I got the phone I checked the number against their oh is your phone compatible on the website and it wasn't. I was very frustrated I even set up to start a new return with this but then, I was on with the people on chat and I was trying to figure it out and I even said I was going to try and go somewhere else. But here's the thing even though that they wouldn't help me and they kind of have some sucky customer service. I have a very cheap bill with them I just have to have my cable with them to get them and then each month it's just I think it's like $12 per gigabyte of data that you use and since I don't use data I don't have a bill each month because my phone is paid off I have nothing else going on there so I have a really great deal with them so I want to keep with them so. So before I decided to actually ship it back I pulled my chip card out of my old phone and slid it into this one here and eureka! My phone actually works really well I didn't have to change anything with my carrier all I had to do was change my SIM card and the phone is compatible even if they tell you it's not compatible So I would say give that a try if you do have Xfinity, and then if it works great if not I'm sorry you'll have to look for something else considering the stage shouldn't work but mine works and I've been doing it for two months now and haven't had any disruptions with my service everything has been great and I haven't had to change my billing at all so I have really enjoyed having this phone. I hope my review has been helpful. If it has been helpful, please hit the helpful button.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Good phone to use,Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Switching from iPhone 8 was a breeze. Loaded with features and speed. Surprisingly good battery life - I went 48 hours between charges. No extra bloatware from the phone company (Samsung, LG, etc.) not from the mobile provider (ATT, Mobile, etc.). Perfect size for the pocket. Beautiful pictures (not as good as iPhone 11). AND it is only $349! Really happy.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Texting on it now. Highly recommended. Reliable and great battery life,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is a perfectly sized phone. No large bezels so it's almost all screen, and small enough to fit in your pocket. Thanks to a plastic back, it's also lightweight compared to phones with a heavy glass back. To the people griping about plastic; most people immediately put a case on their phone, so I don't see the big deal. And the plastic back is one less thing to break if you drop it. The camera takes fantastic pictures and NightSight & Portrait Mode are unbelievable. It takes photos that rival phones costing 2 or 3 times as much. If you enable Battery Optimization, the phone will learn which apps you use the most, withholding power to apps you rarely/never use. After enabling this feature, I only charge my phone about every other day, now.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
So many recommended it in my family. Easy to transfer everything. Takes my Verizon Sims card. Photos are amazing.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Biggest issue is screen turns on in landscape format and takes a few seconds to get back to normal portrait. Never had this with any previous phone, including my first Pixel phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
This pixel 4A is horrible. There are so many glitches it is ridiculous. The key bad constantly messes up letters. And the screen sensitivity is so much that when you're scrolling through pages it will randomly select links that you do not want. The fingerprint to unlock the screen has a long delay and takes a few seconds to open. The Pixel 2 I had before is superior to this phone in every way! I need to return this immediately.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"At this price point, the Google Pixel 4a is almost perfect. Coming from a flagship user I was definitely skeptical about the 4a, that is, until I had it running and in my hands. Here's some key points: Screen: Very clean gorilla glass 3 - almost edge to edge display along with the hole-punch camera. The camera hole is a bit bigger than the others, but again for the price, it's easily forgivable. The screen is very crisp for 1080p, it's just lacking brightness. There isn't fast refresh available, but it doesn't bother me. Body: The body is plastic, which is fine because it feels nice, fingerprints can't be seen and it should be more durable than glass. The only thing I see being different than what I'm used to is the weight of this device, its so light it feels like it disappears in your pocket but almost feels too light in the hands. Not bad just not what I'm used to. The back of the phone is where the fingerprint scanner is located and its very fast in my experience. Cameras: Only a single camera module in the rear which is expected for the price. This camera is surprisingly good, great detail, auto focus, portraits and videos. Front module is not as impressive, but certainly usable. Chipset: This device has a Snapdragon730 paired with 6gb of RAM and it's really snappy. I'm not sure if it's a lack of bloatware, but transitioning between apps was smooth and made it feel like more of a premium phone. Storage for this device is fixed at 128gb with no expansion available. Battery: Is a 3140mah Li-po unit that lasted an entire day for me and I consider myself a heavy user. Charging is available at 18w which is nice for charging to 100% in about 1.5hrs. This phone offers reverse charging via USB, but I never used this feature. It does not support wireless charging but that's OK because I'm sure it keeps the price down and I don't use wireless charging all the time. Overall I'm quite impressed by this little, but powerful device. It's a perfect phone for someone getting into smartphones or someone who doesn't want to break the bank replacing an old phone. The only con I saw using this device was the sound quality; Anything above 50-60% and the body vibrates a lot and the sound quality just isn't great. Other than that I would highly recommend the Google Pixel 4a.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"For the price this is really a lot of phone (nice display, good camera, 128 gig storage, 3yrs of OS upgrades). But there are several negatives you should be aware of: Battery life - OK, but not great Processor - OK, but not great Display - looks great but there is an area about 10 - 20 pixels big all around the right edge and bottom where the phone does not register any touches. Very annoying in games and any app with buttons way at the right/bottom. The Pixel Launcher takes a huge chunk of the display for Google to use as they please (can be fixed by switching to the Nova Launched, but it's annoying to have to do that) Not water proof No wireless charging I really like the smaller size and can live with the problems for a couple years, but I'll be upgrading in 3yrs... UPDATE: Added 1 star - the biggest disappointment for me was the dead-to-the-touch zone around the edge, it turns out that was caused by Android 11 gestures. Once I changed the UI to instead use the 3 buttons (Back\Home\Nav) at the bottom, that problem went away.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Perfect size and better ai than anyone else. After leaving the apple cult I first tried samsung and didn't like the clutter, size (galaxy9plus) or the general controls. Not only is the pixel smarter and smaller, it is also very clean and gives you just what you need. Also, has the headphone jack in an era where it's quickly disappearing as an option. Recommended!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Cheap inferior phone (in all aspects) except the camera. And by cheap I mean cheap. The body and screen are decent, however, the speaker quality is so dismal I am considering to selling it. 4a is at least a decent(ish) value for money and the camera punches above its weight. I initially got Pixel 5 but had to sell it because it had very much the same issues except it cost $650. The whole experience of 4a is very imbalanced. I miss the audio quality and materials of my Samsung Galaxy S7 every minute and that is a five year old phone. The drop in quality is shocking. If you use the phone as a phone, something designers at Goggle probably don't, you'll want to hurl it through the window soon. It is practically unusable as a speaker phone which is something the competition does usually very well. The loudspeaker accentuates any minor issues participants may have with their lines: the one that is a tad too bassy buzzes and sounds hollow, faint lines sound fainter etc. Samsung figured this out years back! Similarly, you will almost never be able to set the loudness level correctly between ringtones, alarms, media volumes between loudspeaker use and headphone use. Imagine you set your ringtone so that you can hear it in normal use. Then you switch to headphones to play a song. Then someone calls you. Your eardrums will almost explode because the phone is too dumb to adjust for headphones! Perhaps I am too focussed on the audio quality. But for me it is a key function. There is a lot of hype about Google products but substance is simply not there. Google sells you cheap iron designed by a team who really do not know how to make it work together. And a good camera. However, the competition caught up with the latter as well. I am still considering selling this phone too. Not happy.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This is my second Google Pixel 4a in that last 4 months. They both crapped out. My phone's screen suddenly became unresponsive. I rebooted but when it came back up it wanted me to enter my pin and I couldn't. I was receiving phone calls, but couldn't answer them. Screen is just completely not responsive to touch. I didn't drop it. There hasn't been water damage. Won't be getting another one.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I love this phone, but tonight the camera did what's showing: brown lines in between. I don't know whether is because is a brand new model and it hasn't have any improvements or is just the camera. I don't want to return the phone but if this keeps going I will have to.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"At the time of purchase, the unlocked Google Pixel 4a is not compatible with T-Mobile, no matter what the above product information says. I went to two separate T-Mobile stores and confused the hell out of some poor store associates who tried their damndest to get it to work, but they concluded that it just isn't compatible. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IF YOU HAVE T-MOBILE!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel ""a"" series of phones seems like a great deal, delivering an excellent camera at an excellent price. Unfortunately, they are too good to be true - the quality and reliability are so compromised that I can't tolerate them any more. I previously had the 3a, and that screen cracked 3 times on me - no other smart phone screen has ever cracked for me. After the third ruined screen, I replaced it with the 4a. The 4a's SIM card reader broke in less than a year. I tried replacing the SIM card but the phone remained nonfunctional - meaning the phone, messages, and mobile data don't work (although it's still a computer that works over WiFi). I ordered a replacement under warranty, and Google - get this - shipped it GROUND from Chicago to California. It took a week to arrive. And when the replacement arrived, it lasted less than a day. The replacement phone got stuck in boot mode as soon as I transferred my data (the picture), and I can't even perform a factory reset. I contacted support, and they can't factory reset the phone either. Now I want to return the replacement phone, and Google is refusing to provide a shipping label to return the broken phone until they receive and process the original phone. So that would be an additional 2-week delay if we go through returning the original phone, processing it, returning the replacement phone, and shipping a new one. I'd be out of a phone for 3 weeks. Anyway, no more Pixels for me - apparently the cheap price reflects such cheap components that the phones aren't reliable, and I need to have a working phone. NOTE: After a request to escalate the problem, multiple weeks, lots of emails, and two separate shipments for returns, Google fully refunded me for the original phone. I believe this is over and above what the warranty required, and so I've upgraded from 1 to 3 stars.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have had my previous phone for a long time and it's just begun to go wonky. I know old phones create a problem at disposal for our planet, so I have been holding onto the old one for many years. In fact, it was my first mobile phone. So switching to a new phone for me is similar to buying a 2015 car with computer and electronics vs my 20 year old car with none. I expect I will be using this for some time without having a clue how to use all its features. So I will just address the basics. The power button is in a horrible place and I am forever hitting it. So that sucks. It is thankfully silver, so at least it is easy to see. And the phone is motion activated, so having the screen light up on pick up is a feature I can get used to fast!👍 Screen resolution is a huge improvement as are many basics. Just had my first spam call and was delighted to have the option to reply with Google's spam filter and messaging that asks the caller to leave their id and message. I saw it in real time as text to confirm it was a caller looking to sell something. The ring tones are nice too, the message function kinda clunky, system settings were difficult to find, so much so I eventually created a desktop shortcut to access them. The recorded audio quality sounds muffled (when I set up my vm message) and the camera, which I though would be exceptional, oddly interprets some colors. I use it to post pics of my paintings to Instagram, and it couldn't tell the difference between teal and blue. Battery life is good. To transfer data between the new phone and the old was a pain because only after contacting tech support did I find out the enclosed usb cable ONLY works between Pixel phones! They really should include info like that with the cable/instructions and alert you when you buy. I had to buy a new cable for this one time use and wait until I had it in hand before I could transfer my contact list, etc. This phone cost me more than my Dell desktop computer and large screen. I think it's highway robbery what this and other even more expensive phones cost, but it is what it is. The position of the on switch exactly where you hold it, really is lousy design that I have to deal with every time I pick it up.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I love my new phone, it fits perfectly for my small hands, I love the quality of the camera, the design is awesome, battery life is just amazing.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I have been a Pixel user for many years, but this has been a horrible experience, and I really think it's on Amazon, and not Pixel. I bought it refurbished from Amazon, thinking I could trust them. Nope. The boatloader is unlocked. I can't use Google Pay in stores. Half my apps won't even download. It won't let me turn on my hotspot even though I pay for one. Really disappointed.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I was really surprised at how much I like this phone. It is now my favorite and I have several phones including some newer flagships. This phone is fast. The speakers are great and I enjoy having the headphone jack again since my flagship phones don't have them now. Of course the camera is good. It is a pixel. The screen is good and I love the haptics. This phone is really fun to use. The Pixel 4a is a great phone especially for the price.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Compared to Iphone SE, i would prefer this..!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I bought this on a whim after using various Galaxy phones since 2013. Being very adjusted to that version of Android OS that Galaxy uses, it's weird at first to see Google's take on an Android OS but after only about an hour or two, it's pretty convenient in this phone. My least favorite part about getting a new phone is transferring all my previous data to a new device, but Android to Android makes this process so streamlined, I had all my music, photos, apps, wallpapers, and smaller settings in about 15 minutes from when I first booted the phone up. A few things I think that makes this device stand out is that it's like an iPhone XS with an Android OS running it. The display is clear and sharp, the touch is consistent, the camera is superb for the price that you pay, and the software is rather simple and clean to use. If you're concerned about the punch-out camera in the top left of the screen like I was, don't worry. It's barely noticeable when using the device like normal. This phone's size is pretty comfortable when it comes to one handed use. The matte finish on the back side gives the device a nice feel when it's being used. So far, I really like my Pixel 4a and I'm happy I jumped ship. If you're someone who wants a phone for more basic tasks while being streamlined, then pick this up and give it a go, you won't be disappointed.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Given that the Pixel is around 1/3 the cost of my current iPhone, I consider it a viable substitute. Here's what I like and dislike about it: (+) Smaller than my iPhone yet feels right. In the course of usage, you don't feel that the size is inadequate. (+) Apps are very useful if you chose to activate the phone no. I watch the news via this phone, which saves my iPhone's battery life. (+) Battery life is quite adequate. Through ""heavy"" usage, I manage only to reach 1/2 battery life. Dislikes: (-) Actually, my only peeve is that it could be easy to pair. I don't think the process is all that intuitive.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Love this phone. Google still has some work to do in terms of small bugs, but this phone is amazing! Camera quality amazing, no problem with fingerprint sensor, the speakers sound incredible(almost like a dolby enhanced speaker when full volume). I can use this phone and it lasts basically all day with heavy usage. It feels and runs like a very solid premium phone (I don't care about glass, I care about feeling of durability).

I do a little bit of everything, and it handles it all well, especially tasks that made my poor old phone crumple, like loading huge Google Doc files.

GREAT QUALITY PHONE FOR LOW PRICE,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I have always had expensive iPhones (over $1 K), but now that I am retired I cannot afford that kind of money for a phone. I am also totally SICK of Apple, as their security on phones and iCloud is so extreme and bizarre that I have wasted many hours on their help line. Did you know that if Apple mistakingly thinks you are in Hong Kong, they will change your entire phone to traditional Chinese? That took me 5 hours on the phone to rectify. And puzzles me ... even if I WAS suddenly in Hong Kong, I would NOT suddenly start reading and speaking in traditional Chinese. In any event, I could not take the stress any more, so I decided to take the BIG step of divorcing Apple and moving to Android. I expected to have a big learning curve, but I just watched a few YouTube videos, and the transition was seamless. Within 24 hours I was IN LOVE with this phone. The screen is gorgeous, the speed is more than good enough, the battery life is awesome, and the apps are marvelous. It can do EVERYTHING my iPhones used to do. The difference is that downloading my photos to my computer is easy and a sheer pleasure. I NEVER get locked out because, for example, I have travelled to Mexico and suddenly Apple is suspicious of me. Oh, and the camera is super important to me. That is why, after a lot of research, I chose this particular phone. Well, the camera is outstandingly excellent. I am thrilled about the astral photography. For a third of the price I paid for my iPhone 6, I now have a camera that is about 3x better. I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone - the best one I have ever had in my life. And this is coming from someone who has had decades of flagship phones from Apple. I feel sorry for all those who still think that nothing but an iPhone would do. I would rather go back to pay phones than ever own an iPhone again.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Nice phone,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I love the camera!!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Very nice device for that price, has everything we need. NFC, fingerprint reader, good quality camera (although front facing camera can be a bit better, but overall it's a decent camera), Android 10 and many more. Would recommend for sure. :)",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Just got the pixel 4a on Friday release day when all the Amazon units started arriving, 3 days ago and loved it. Battery life seemed great and the phone was snappy. But after the 2nd day I noticed the 4a would not stop rebooting and I could not figure it out as I was not running any new apps. After scratching my head and playing around with it, it seems to be a physical build quality issue where the battery power source is interrupted. See the video of me tapping the phone on my desk and it just turning off, repeatable every time. After I filmed this video the phone would not turn back on. I posted this issue to Reddit and someone else confirmed they had the exact same issue. There must be some major quality control issue.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Takes awesome photos. Excellent phone at an excellent price. Definitely the best value on the market!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I felt like it was time for an upgrade and I began my search for a durable phone. I needed a phone with great battery life and a camera that takes selfies very quickly. When I looked into Google's offerings, I was enticed by the features and most importantly the PRICE! For only $350, I get a high-res camera, 24-hour battery life, a bright and crisp screen, a fast processor, and most shockingly a headphone jack. Many new flagship phones have been phasing it out since 2016, but I did not expect it to be featured on a brand-new phone from a big company like Google. I believe my purchase is a great value, and it's rare to get that feeling whenever I buy something new. I'm confident this phone will last me another few years (Google even has promised 3 years of firmware updates). I believe this is one of the most daring Android phones I've had in the past several years.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"This phone is really perfect for the price. I got this to replace my Pixel 2 XL. Very snappy and responsive. Does everything I need it to do, no bloatware, simple and clean Android. Perfect size, beautiful screen, and the pictures are always perfect, just point and shoot! Also love the features like call screening, captions, and voice recording. The battery life is awesome. It doesn't have a lot of extraneous bells and whistles, it just works. A great value for $349! I highly recommend.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I am not a game enthusiast person. Not even a single game is installed in my phone So for all my other office work, podcast work, editing etc this phone is very good. no doubt that for this much price a good phone has been release after a long time by Google. Only complaint I can say is when I opened my phone, after setup I could see it was charged 67% and under battery settings I could see it was charged to full battery 14hr before it was delivered to me. This leads to suspicion that box was unboxed and tested before sending to me. Not sure if this has any flaw about battery as the phone gets heated up very quickly. cons: heats up quickly",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I can't understand why phones are getting so large, approaching mini tablets I need something that fits in my hand and pocket and this works great for that Software and all the programs run smoothly, the camera is impressive especially considering it's a single lens and the Unicorn Beetle case I got for it pairs nicely Can't speak to the transfer process from other phones with the included cables since I prefer to start fresh with new phones, but it was a nice addition I hadn't gotten with other devices May update in a few months if I have other relevant/useful thoughts",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"UPDATE: Google released another update which fixed the touchscreen issue. ORIGINAL: Loved the phone until the Android 11 update. Now, with a screen protector installed, the touchscreen is too sensitive and the phone is unusable. Works ok without the screen protector, but that risks permanent damage to the screen. It's a known issue and Google had had weeks to fix it.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"It took a bit of work, but I was able to unlock the boot loader and flash with someone's custom version of lineageOS. For those looking for a degoogled phone this seems to be the simplest option I've ran into. I am not impressed with the battery life, but I have been able to get 1-2 days out of it. The phone's performance feels like my Samsung S9, but the plastic build of the phone is horrible. It is lighter weight than my S9, but being plastic it isn't as good to hold and slides on everything. I highly recommend getting a case for it!",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I really love this phone, it takes a good photo in night for me.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Pros: great camera Affordable price Cons: phone functions are deeply inconsistent 1 out of 3 calls received you aren't given the option to decline ( you can ""screen"" the call, answer or message them) Why are there 3 different screens that pop up for incoming calls all with different options? The ""do not disturb"" does not work. It mutes incoming calls and notifications but it will STILL interrupt anything you are using your phone for ( music, streaming video, etc, it stops any of that regardless). Functions are glitchy and inconstant Rotate screen only works 50% of the time There is no sd card to expand memory or protect your photos Google designed this phone so it could browse your data and try and sell things to you, they especially love going through your photos and trying to sell them back to you. Skip this phone, it's a trap.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I wish the call volume would go a little higher, but it is still a great 5 star phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Affordable. Fast processing. Good phone. Apple transfer and Verizon activation I switched from Apple w/o access to apple cloud (locked out). I was able to bring all gmail and google photos. Many gmail contacts had phone associated but not all. Verizon store charged $20 for SIM. And I paid $20 for transfer and activation assistance. Ship speed Amazon was accurate about ship time. But I wish it was a true 2 day prime delivery. Mine took 4 days.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
The main reason why I bought this phone was because I needed a better camera. And oh man does this phone really have a great camera. I added two photos I took with this camera. The ocean picture was at night in the complete dark. I was amazed to see how that photo came out. Besides the camera this phone has an amazing battery life and is very responsive. For the price this phone is unbeatable Pros Price Camera Responsiveness Design (very slim and sleek),Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I'm really enjoying the Pixel 4a. It's slightly smaller than my last couple of phones, which makes it slightly easier to hold. It's faster than my OnePlus 5T was. I like that Google supports it so much that I get early access to the newest Android releases.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Great battery life. Camera is good for amateurs, I find it gimmicky, annoying if you are in an app and try to swype from the edge of the page, it closes the app.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The main selling point of this phoneis the pure Android experience. Pure Android isn't very good. The phone cannot transfer files via usb, and the help doesn't work. There's only one entry in the help page, and it directs the user to an option that is grayed out. There is no further help. Google advertises their spam blocker. But the user must decide if a new number is spam or not before reading the new number's message. A user can't read the message and then mark a new number as spam. The swipe commands (back, home, etc) conflict with homepage navigation. There's no way to mute a conversation in Messages other than blocking the senders. The phone has many annoyances like that and very few optoins to correct them. It just isn't very good.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Wow besides call quality it's the best phone ever. The google chrome alone was worth the price,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"The Pixel 4a is the best phone I've ever owned. It's performance is very good, the size is great in my hand, and the camera is really good. Even though it's only maybe 1cm smaller than other phones it really fits in the hand much better. The plain Android software works well, and it gets regular software updates. Other than that it's much the same as any other Android phone. Battery life is pretty good, not as good as phones with larger batteries but you do have to compromise a little when you choose a small phone - there's not much space for the battery in there. I charge my battery to 80% and most days with light use it's at about 40 - 50% at the end of the day. If I use it really heavily it would probably still last the day but it'd be pretty low so I tend to do a top-up charge. The supplied charger tops the phone up really quickly, which heats the phone up a little more than I'd like so I tend to use a medium speed charger most of the time, but it's great if I'm in a hurry.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
Excellent phone. I upgraded from a google pixel to the 4a and it was painless. It comfortably fits in my hands and back pocket. The battery lasts about 8-10 hours of continuously being used or two days for my average usage.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I've had this Pixel 4a for about 3 weeks. It's been excellent so far. The transfer of data was really cool and easy. I moved the SIM card from my old phone to my new phone took just a matter of a few minutes for it to start working. There was a problem with the SIM card manager but that was resolved by restoring to the previous version of the SIM card manager app. I'm very happy with the smaller size of the phone.,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I didn't need to buy this phone. But it was so cheap that I bought one just to play with a modern Pixel phone. For the money, this is probably the best phone you can buy, especially on the Android side, and especially if you love that ""pure Android"" factor. Yes, Pixels aren't ""pure Android"", but close enough in a post-Nexus world. And the Pixel-specific features are outstanding. Even though the camera isn't the top-tier hardware we'd expect from flagships, Google's computational photography is unrivaled. Compared to my iPhone 11 and older Galaxy S8+, the Pixel 4a absolutely is at least as good, if not better. I bought this phone, however, to test the video capabilities. No surprise, it's not as good as the iPhone 11. But again, for the money, it's really good. Filmic Pro will overheat the phone when shooting in high resolutions and frame rates, but that's expected on Android anyway. The biggest downside for this phone is the screen--it's definitely not bright enough, but it still looks good. The fingerprint reader is blazing fast, and despite being a much lower power processor in this phone it still holds up quite well to most use cases. Honestly, if you want a Pixel without paying nearly flagship prices, this should be your pick.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"Excellent phone, quick delivery to hong kong just a bit over two weeks, i really like the phone, excellent size and camera quality and best of all the price.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I like this phone for 1) up-to-date OS 2) its not huge (its about the same size as the Moto G5 plus it replaced, but the screen is larger because the bezels are smaller) 3)responsive 4)Transferring apps/settings/files from my previous android phone was easy; came with a USB connector for this purpose 5)The OS is starting to incorporate some of the better windows phone features. Note the time displayed when the phone is idle in the photo. Also, when the phone wakes up, you go directly to your home screen. No more wake swipe-swipe to get to something. Cons: gesture navigation is a mixed bag. I like having more screen real estate, but the back swipe interferes with in-app navigation. Bluetooth still seems to be a mess, you still can't easily put a shortcut to connect to just one specific device. Other: For me, the battery can last two days with light use, with typical use I'm maybe down to 33% at the end of the day.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"Worst new phone experience I`ve ever had. After spending lots of time to authenticate and configure in all apps I`ve installed my T-Mobile SIM card and discovered that the pone doesn`t have service. After troubleshooting with support, visiting T-Mobile store and trying all possible things including few other SIM cards I`m going to return it. Just waisted lot of time and energy on this. It has failed at the most basic phone feature - being a phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android
I got my opened box Pixel 4a from Amazon Warehouse about 3 months ago and today the phone just wouldn't turn on out of the blue. Tried to manually reboot but nothing happened. Beware with opened box devices!,Google,Pixel 4a,Android
"I wanted a better camera than my previous android and this one is great. However, when in camera mode the screen is too 'touchy' - when taking a still pic, the slightest 'graze' of my finger somehow triggers it into video mode. Maybe it's just because it's such a small phone. As an 'old guy' with reading glasses, I bemoan this current fad aspect ratio of 19 - 9, seems pointless, makes the usable screen smaller. I don't stream movies, play video games, apps etc. I'm strictly Phone, Text and Camera, so all the bells and whistles mean nothing to me, I turn off most of the 'lifestyle crap'. The build quality seems good, but I've only had it for a week. Screen is sharp, but again, a bit small for me. Hopefully Google will eventually make more of a 'Phablet' for us old guys. I activated it with Esim, which went surprisingly soothly, and switching to google Fi will save me some money on phone bill (hopefully)",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"My Pixel 2 was a great camera phone but it was showing its age. I shopped and compared. I really wanted my next phone to have an optical telephoto lens. But the few phones that have that feature are at least 3 times as expensive as the Pixel 4a. If it had a telephoto lens at a similar price it would get 5 stars. (I don't understand the need for the wide angle lens on other new models of the Pixel.) I could take a ""real camera"" with me, but I have found in recent years that when I do, I still use the phone for most shots. The Pixel 4a does not have the latest engine, but it is still much faster and smoother than my old one. It doesn't have the largest battery, but for normal use battery life has been far better than on my old phone. One great feature of this phone was the easy transfer of files and apps from the old Pixel. I highly recommend this phone.",Google,Pixel 4a,Android

"I hate this phone. I have nothing bad to say about the seller, it arrived quickly and is what was promised. However, I find this phone absolutely maddening and have wanted to throw it or drop kick it so many times that I've lost count. The most annoying feature is it's accidental touch protection. If you set the phone down, like on a table, and you want to use it, you cannot. It will not respond to touch unless you pick it up. There is a place to turn it off in the settings, but it still does this even after you tell it not to. It is a large, heavy phone and I do not always want to hold it, I should be able to set it down and use it, but no. Accidental touch is not something I've ever even worried about with smart phones. I don't know why they felt it was a necessary feature. I used a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge for four years and switching to this phone was painful. I'm comparison, this phone is a cheap pos. I really like the Google sky map app, it won't work on this phone. After about a month of use, it's decided it doesn't work inside my house. All calls are garbled and it drops most of them. It frequently loses connection to the network when outside of the home as well. I would give it zero stars if possible. I wish I understood the difference between the s model and the a model before purchasing because I would not have bought this phone.

The A10s is a very good phone. Definitely worth the price. Nice big screen close in size to most high end phones. Screen is good not perfect but very good. Scrolling is nice and smooth most of the time. Colors are good. Not the most capable phone but if you want something simple cheap and big this is the right choice. Speaker is probably the only thing I would complain about. Doesn't have the best sound quality. A nice pair of galaxy buds will fix that. Blue light filter could also be better. Great budget phone.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
Buyers beware. This phone is not meant for US consumers. I have t mobile and I bought this phone for my aunt who is in my plan. When I put the sim card in this phone it will do everything but give you 4g. The reason it will not give you 4g is because it's not meant to be used in United States.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

Excited to get the phone so I can a surprise him when I go to see him for his birthday and inboxing the phone increased my excitement. The phone is sleek and very easy to hold; until I went to set it up. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOURE USING IT IN THE US. The Phone I received (don’t know if they’re all the same) had NO OPTION TO SELECT ENGLISH AS YOUR LANGUAGE. It starts off with Spanish and has the drop down window to select your language of choice. However NO OPTION FOR ENGLISH. Even though the description says US + International and can be used on T-Mobile network. Plus it had a lot of positive reviews I figured I couldn’t go wrong.

"I don't know if the issues I'm having with this phone is due to the fact that it was used or if it's because the a10s is just not a great phone. The camera and the flash are out of sync. When I need the flash to take a picture the flash goes off before the picture is taken and the picture quality is not very good. My Galaxy s9 takes great pictures. Also, I have to tap on icons several times to get the phone to react. I'm going to return this phone and buy another s9. The finger print reader works fine, the battery life is very good, and the face recognition is functional. But the other issues make this a sub par phone in my opinion.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"Everything about this phone is decent, but it's a bit slow. My main complaint is that, in order to encourage people to get higher end, more expensive models. Samsung seems to have made it so that if you record video, the audio and video go out of sync. It's obviously done on purpose, as older Samsung phones don't have this issue. Otherwise, this runs the apps I need for banking and social media just fine.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

Sure I can accept that, but I find that hard to believe since a refurbished product is usually tested.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"Barely CAN$200 with taxes included, this phone is a steal. It has virtually everything you'd expect for a modern smartphone. Works quickly, has a moderate amount of stock space, the camera is decent; the one low-point may be the speaker which isn't that impressive. An improvement over its similar predecessor the A10, this A10-S includes a fingerprint scanner which works great, as well as an improved location for the speaker (on the bezel of the phone instead of on the back which was easily muffled) — yet, it's priced almost identically to its predecessor. I will say one thing, I first bought a ""defective"" A10S and had to return it for a replacement, but I wasn't even sure if it was a one-off defect until I bought another one which didn't end up having the problem. The issue I had was that the touch screen was less responsive along the side edges of the screen, so when I tried to press keys like ""P"", or ""L"", or the backspace button it didn't always respond to my touch. The top pull-down menu also didn't work when the phone was flat. I thought it might have just been something I had to deal with because of the economical value of the phone, but it WAS a defect. If your A10S has this problem, return it for another one because that's not supposed to happen. Overall, if you're not someone who needs to have the latest most expensive Iphone and just needs a good phone that works and has all the features you need.... save yourself about $800 and buy this phone. It's an excellent value.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"I had already purchased this phone and was very happy with it and would have given it 4 stars (camera is just OK) but I dropped it and the glass was shattered. I clicked on the ""buy it again"" button on my order page expecting to get the same phone. I did not. It looked the same but there were important differences. The first clue that something was wrong was the adapters in the box which were not compatible with any electrical outlet I have. Next, after transferring all my data I noticed several unusual things. Any app that spoke had a british accent (which I didn't mind, but seemed odd). My weather app is set to 24 hour time and no matter how often I change it to 12 hour, it always reverts back to 24 hour. The dates on my email are listed as day/month/year so that March 20th would read 20/3/20. I then discovered an insert in the instructions informing me that the phone was from India and should be activated with a sim card issued in India. If I used a sim issued from another region the phone might not function properly. I live in Pennsylvania and that is where my sim card was issued. I called customer service, explained the situation and they sent me a new phone, assuring me that my experience was a mistake that would not happen again. My 2nd new phone came, again with the weird adapters and sure enough, a card that said the phone was an Indian phone to be activated with a sim card issued in India. That phone is also going back and I have ordered a completely different phone. Read the phone description carefully before purchasing. If it says International phone, do not order it!",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"Many dual SIM phones have only two card slots, one for a SIM and one that can be used for either a second SIM or a microSD card, but not both. This phone has three slots in its card tray, two for nano SIMs plus a dedicated microSD slot, so no sacrifice is necessary. Has an FM radio chip and includes wired ear buds to use as an antenna. Minimal bloatware, only thing I'd like to delete but can't is Facebook. Flashlight is super bright but only has one brightness level, 100%, unlike my previous Samsung which had four. No magnetic compass sensor, which is no biggie with GPS or if you can determine heading from the sun, moon, and time. No NFC so no support for contactless payment. Speaker location on the bottom edge to the left of the Micro USB port is unfortunate... my natural operating mode is left handed using the thumb to type and little finger to balance the phone, which blocks the speaker. Speaker is also blocked if I hold the phone against my body to stabilize. Speaker is plenty loud and sounds great. Wish it had a USB Type C port and quick charging capability. Display is very sharp, plenty bright. Software supports pretty much any language on the planet... at first turn-on, Español is the default, so pull down to US English if that's your preference. Easy peasy. No problems getting it to work on Metro by T-Mobile... just have to register the IMEI through one of their flirty customer service call center reps, who will waive the $15 fee if you go that route instead of taking it to a store. Had I asked for her number, she probably would have shot back with 611 LOL! Anyway, love the glossy red finish. 2 GB is a little light these days, but I've always used lower end phones so knowing how to minimize RAM footprint is second nature. No problems yet.

I had to return this phone. Not by fault of the seller but because my stepson picked out the wrong type of unlocked phone for his cell carrier. It would not work with Tracfone. It was a nice phone.

"I have no idea how this model got 4.5 stars. There is a defect in this model that causes the data not to work, the phonecalls stop working, the phone doesnt function if its not on wifi. You may be able to troubleshoot it but when i buy brand new technology i dont care to troubleshoot, id just like to use my product. Tied getting a replacement, same exact issues. Then the return process for the replacement was more difficult then I'd like. I'm currently waiting for a ups driver to pick up my phone when I could have just returned it with the other one to Kohl's. Absolutely no kohls drop off as an option and even though amazon gives you a time window for the ups man to arrive ups does not give out time windows whatsoever. Huge discrepancy there. As a consumer I am not happy with amazon nor am I happy with UPS. This isn't my first issue with Amazon and personally I'm beginning to feel that Amazon sucks and I'm about to choose to live without that convenience since it's no longer super convenient. They have absolutely no discourse as to when these issues arrive, no sympathies for their mistakes no sorry for the inconveniences here a percentage or a coupon, a month free for your loyalty to make up for our booboo nothing just a big fat eff you. So if you don't need me then I'll be goin",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

Seller said after the 30 day warranty they offer the window is closed with them. Then if you are outside the USA (main reason why you buy this type of phone) the manufacturer “may or may not cover the Warranty”.

"Por el precio no se puede pedir mucho más, 32gb de almacenamiento, un procesador y ram suficientes para cosas básicas, una pantalla brillante, de tamaño generoso y nítida (en relación con su precio), acabados correctos, dual SIM, jack para audífonos, no está lleno de bloatware y se mueve de forma fluida, no es un s10, así que no se puede comparar, este es un celular de gama baja.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"Each cell phone is different, this one is no different, your preset apps are difficult to remove, some apps appear without permission and are impossible to remove. With no permission from me, it is irritating to know I have no controls that are easy to find. Watched several videos on troubleshooting this phone with little help. When the cell phone was reset evidently microsoft put on new apps which are without my permission. My next cell phone will be well inspected prior to accepting it.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

I can not activated my new phone right now what can I do,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
First one was faulty. Second ones seems fine..apps look different from my Note 9,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"I like the finger print recogition and the feature that you can add multiple finger prints, so I have both my left and right index fingers set up to operate the device. The phone turns on from the side, but also if you place your finger on the reader in the rear, which is a natural way to hold the phone, it's turns on right away. I haven't set up the facial recognition so I can't comment on that. Using the Samsung APP ""Smart Switch"", all my data and APPs transferred to the new phone. I did have to log back in to the APP accounts on the new phone, which was a good safety feature, in my opinion, in case someone where to do it without your knowledge, they wouldn't have immediate access to your information/accounts. I am very happy with this purchase.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

Got phone. It read my sim card. That's what I needed it to do. It came in Spanish. Had to switch it to English. Which was simple. It's a pretty big phone. Sends pixelated videos in text messages.. and the video has to be 10 seconds or less for me to send it..,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

I like how everything worked as described.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"For the price is an excellent device. I bought it for my father and he just loved. The fact that it’s DS makes it even more suitable for the reality of some countries overseas. It is also unlocked. The capacity plus the memory card gives plenty of space to have pictures, conversations and all of the things you may want to store. The face recognition set up is the thing that I found difficult. It worked very well on my face but for some reason on my father’s face wasn’t working. I just gave up on that. But we were able to add the finger print and you can add more than one.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"So happy with this phone. Easy to use,and understand. Great battery life.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
bought this for a work phone no regrets at all,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
It was not unlocked. It didnot meet my expectations,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"Came unlocked, with headphones, cameras (quality) perfect. I hesitated buying this phone because of the mixed reviews, especially about freedom mobile, who I had a plan with. Worked like a charm. And sure, it;s default language was Spanish. But, geez, just change the language settings to whatever. Very pleased. Granted, I still have to tweak it further to my preferences, but no regrets here.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"I bought this product and their was no mention that this phone is in Spanish. It wouldn't change options, I'm very disappointed, and my phone matters just got worse.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

Livraison rapide et très satisfaite des articles. Bonne qualité aussi. Design joli et le téléphone est léger. Je suis hyper contente de mon achat :),Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
Awesome phone. Set up was easy and I have had no issues since with the exception of the memory card it came with. The card kept unmounting itself and has cleared all my data twice. So I threw it away. Initially I thought something was wrong with the card tray but I inserted a new memory card and I now have no issues.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
The imei doesnt match phone to set it up and if you do manage calls or txt data is absolutely unavailable!,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"Per the box, this phone was manufactured for India. I live in the SE United States. The only signal we could receive was the Edge network. It barely worked in wifi, dropped calls, slow connection... Why sell a phone if you're not 100% certain it will work in the area in which it's sold? I returned it and paid a little extra for a sure thing from my mobile provider",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"The audio is not good at all. People tell me they hear me as if I was speaking through a tunnel, and forget about using the speaker, it's even worse. Listening to someone speaking to me on the phone is an agony! And all the audio features are all in the correct setting.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
Love the phone! It was everything and more than I expected.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
I got this phone for my husband and he is so happy with it so far. When he turned it on it walked through nice and easily how to set up his phone. Thank-you so much. And it was also a good affordable phone as well.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"This is my second Samsung galaxy a10S. They are great phones, I just happened to smash my first one, so I ended up ordering the same phone again. This time I recieved a Spanish version of this phone. Getting it set up was a pain but once I got it switched to English and my sim card worked I figured it would be fine. I'm a few weeks into using the phone and it is clear that this phone does not work as well as my previous phone of the same make and model. I contacted customer service in hopes I could get a replacement, but they said i would have to return this phone and order again. Right now I don't have a spare phone to use and can't afford to order another phone before I get my refund, so I'm basically stuck with this knock off. Just wish I got what I ordered",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"I purchased this phone to use in a bring-your-own-phone plan with a mobile phone network...it was a model recommended for a plan requiring WiFi calling. When the phone was set up, it did not function. In discussion with the technical support staff of the mobility network, I discovered that this particular phone is NOT supported by the mobile network available to us in our remote location. The recommendation was WRONG. Other Samsung models will work. I do not know the reason or source for the incorrect recommendation...Samsung or Fido network, but it doesn't matter...phone was returned.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

This is a good looking phone nice display easy to use with nice graphics and storage however I took the phone to the three major carriers and none of them were able to activate it even though it was labeled as unlocked. On the box and in the information pamphlet indicated that the phone would only accept a SIM card in India. Why they are selling it here in the states is confusing but I was able to get a refund in a promt manner.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

The phone was as advertised for a good price. The only issue was the packaging was in Spanish so I had to go on line to get the set up instructions and other information you usually need with a new phone. All elese was great.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"I like that this phone was truly unlocked and didn't have a problem activating it on my carrier. The only issue is that when I try to video call on WhatsApp , my phone powers off.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"Disappointed. I loved my past Samsung phones and did my research on this model. Functions are limited for a phone in this price range: shutter sound on the camera can not be turned off, subpar camera (poor focus, blurry pictures, lag), the reception is awful (drops calls when my service is solid), lag when opening and closing apps. Generally a mediocre phone. Pros: light weight, seems rugged, good battery life, charges fast, has tons of storage.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for my boyfriend. Hes a little rough with phones so we didn't want to spend a whole lot on a new one. It came in brand new in unopened box. The box had writing that wasn't English but that's the first thing you change when you turn on the phone so it wasn't a big deal. Was a little laggy at first but once all the updates finished it was fine. The sim card went in without any issue. All around everything was perfect and he loves his phone. For the price we can't be happier.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"Very nice phone at a very good price, and it's unlocked for any GSM carrier. I live in Panama and it works perfectly with my provider here. It also updated immediately to the latest Android 10 software. Does everything I would ever need.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"I wanna start by saying I LOVE the phone. However, I got the bundle with the sd card and it doesn't work. I tried talking to Amazon for help and it was horrible customer service. Didn't answer my questions, and was very demeaning. While I don't regret the phone, use that extra 8 bucks to get a good sd card so you can avoid the hassle. I'll be buying a new sd card soon 🙄",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
Thank you,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
The initial setup was somewhat complicated for older folks. The call function could be improved. On tapping the call icon one expects to see the keyboard numbers immediately. The appearance of the contact list is not as essential as the keyboard since one already knows the number for which the call is intended. The sound quality could be better. Its a bit squeaky. Otherwise the phone appearance is just fine. I am not technically savvy enough to comment further.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
The SD port was torn I couldn't log back into the phone fingerprint didn't work and the phone was slow only good thing was the camera,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

What I ordered and what was in the description was 2 different things.. the phone I received was locked and for international use only...returned the phone no problems!!,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"I purchased this phone for the express purpose of having a higher version of Android so that I could control two GoPro cameras and other video equipment that my trusty Galaxy 5 could not. I quickly found that it was in Spanish and no amount of trying, for more than a week, proved successful in changing the language. The initial Commence page totally failed to respond to any taps, tap and hold or swipes or system resets.. I eventually called Amazon Support and got a wonderful rep; unfortunately she could not resolve the issue. I was on the verge of returning the phone when one night it magically advanced to the first screen of set up, in Spanish. I am fluent in French so could understand some words and eventually advanced. The next stumbling block was Google insisting I set up a new G Mail account, with no opt out, and no way to use my current Google account. After several days I finally arrived at a screen where I could change the language. I was, at last, able to set everything to my preferences. Quite a very long haul but worth the effort. The phone performs exactly the way I wanted it to and there have been no more issues. I noticed other buyers have encountered language problems with the initial drop down ""Change Language"" failing to work. IF you have the patience and perseverance you'll hit your goal. Delivery was very fast, and, need I say I do not back off from challenges! Be aware: A10s [Spanish] A10e [English].",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"This item is not described correctly. In the description it says that this is a unlocked smart phone, and on the bottom of the box it says it’s a locked smart phone. When I tried to activate it with my wireless provider they confirmed for me that indeed it was a locked smart phone and they could not activate it. I would not recommend buying this phone.

Battery life is very good (after using it all day it's still at 60% when I get home). Uses micro-usb port though which there are not a lot of options for charging cables to buy. Came with headphones, charging cable and sooner than expected. Overall a great purchase.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"Absolutely the most aggravating pile of trash i have ever used. It's comparable to a defective Blu phone. I honestly didn't even finish updates before i knew i hated it. I will never buy a samsung again. Guaranteed. The price cannot be justified just because of the storage. I prefer using my broken ran over 50$ LG. The swyping is unforgivable, doesn't auto space in Google search, literally swypes words that words that doesn't exist in three English language, and oh yeah i checked and triple checked language settings spell checking. Now considering this is a phone.... i should be able to call and gave a conversation, that would be nice. However the ""sim card data has changed, device will reset automatically"" happens every 10 seconds to 2 minutes killing my service. Now. Even more embarrassing is the sound quality. Im talking my kyocera from 1999 DUMPS on this thing, so quiet sounds like only half the speakers work, they sound super chincy. Just cheap crap. On to Samsung customer service. Not good. Ima just leave it at that. Id rather blindfold myself and play in heavy high speed traffic than use this phone. I refuse to return that abomination,. it will be destroyed with 5 lbs of tannerite",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

I am disappointed that this phone was not brand new. No where in the description does it mention that is is a pre owned or USED phone. My phone already game with someone else's information TIMTHEGAMER204@GMAIL.COM. I would like some of my money back. Why would I pay full price for something that is used and not new? I purchase pre owned items often but not for the same price as a new item. That is absurd. As a seller you should be honest. You already know this phone was pre owned. List that so as a consumer I can make my proper decision. You should make this right.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"It freezes too much. Can't send more than 2-3 pics per text. Can't send video or audio longer than 10 seconds. Sends my screenshots & videos very blurry... My J3 Prime (4yr old phone) I replaced with this phone was capable of more. My Galaxy S5 6yrs ago did better. Sh¡t, even my phones from 10 years ago sent at least 1min of audio, 30sec videos, & 6pics per text. This phone is too new & nice to have these horrible qualities. RIDICULOUS! And the weather & city location stays inaccurate no matter how many times & ways I tried to adjust it. Unacceptable for a brand new phone from 2019. Best thing about this phone is the battery life. From my experience at least... It was great at 1st. After a couple weeks, every few days something new would kick in. And I periodically clean all my phones data, cache, texts, etc. Very disappointed. Especially since I bought a case & screen protectors... Replacing it with the Galaxy A71. Twice the price, but oh well. Just came out a few months ago & it's as closest I can get to a newer S series at the moment. Hopefully it doesn't let me down like this one.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

Absolute junk. I was locked out of phone on day 1 of recieving it. as soon as i pluged in the charger i could no longer access phone. It kept saying wrong pattern. Amazon would not refund until i returned it. So basicly youl have to buy a new phone then ask for refund or be out a phone for 2 weeks waiting on your new one to arive and waist half your months phone bill with no phone.. DO NOT BUY THIs OR ANY PHONE FROM AMAZON. Save time and money and go to a store .

Ive had this phone about 2-3 months & hace dropped possibly over a handful of times and no cracks. Sound quality is okay, not the Loudest. The battery is good, it can last all day Maybe two depending on phone usage. Im on my phone frequently and last me all day if full charge. It can also take a while to charge. If you live in the U.S. you may have to call your phone carrier customer line or in store to activate your IMEI to their Network in order to get phone service. I wasted about 2 days trying to do it myself 🤦🏽‍♀️ when i couldve just called customer Service and got it activated in less than 5-10 minutes. Also this phone is compatible with MOST GSM carriers NOT all, (Ex. Metro PCS, T-Mobile). It is not compatible with CDMA carriers (Ex. Verizon, Sprint). It tells us in the description box. Most importantly review the company reviews you plan to purchase the phone from so you can have an idea of what youre getting yourself into. All in all I am highly satisfied with my phone.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"The phone works for basic calls and text but there is no mobile data which means no internet unless you are on wi-fi. It also means no MMS messages so no sending or receiving pictures. We've tried ATT and T Mobile. I bought two of these last year for my husband and daughter and they were/are fine. So I ordered one for Christmas for my mom (hit reorder on the one I bought for my husband). It took my mom a while to realize that it didn't give her MMS messages. So I ate the $150 bucks because it was too late to return. Hit reorder on the phone for my daughter, got the international phone again. This time I'm returning right away.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

This is one of Samsung's budget phones it's okay it's not particularly big but it's not small either the red color shines a little bit dull probably because of the plastic but it doesn't have a premium look to it if you're looking for something cheap with a premium look this isn't it as far as functionality goes fingerprint reader everything that it has works okay nothing to get excited about this is a perfect budget phone for a family member or maybe a child that needs something good they would definitely be happy with this. only problem I do have is that when I got the phone it was not sealed in plastic,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

Beautiful,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
purchased this phone twice the first phone one we got the call quality was horrible it would scramble and drop calls constantly. When trying to call out it would take a minute or two literally before it would ring to the person you were calling. It hardly ever had service bars on it which made it even harder to communicate with someone when it finally dialed out. we thought that phone was just defective so we sent that phone back and ordered another one. Got that one in and it did the same exact thing. So we sent that one back too and are still waiting on our refund.Its a beautiful phone but not all things that are pretty are worth a crap. Its a really crappy phone. Not worth the money or the headache.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. Mine is perfect. When you load the phone for the first time it gives you the option to change from spanish to english. I loved how it could communicate with my own phone after I downloaded an app on my old phone to transfer everything from my old phone to the new one. I had even written down the apps I had figuring I would have to download them all again but I didn't have to yay!!! Someone mentioned they didn't get a manual. I did but I don't need a manual. If you have had an android before you should be able to operate this without a manual. I was pleasantly surprised to get a hands free device with my new phone and my sim card went in the same way as my other phone so I had no issues there. All and all a great phone for the price. I also bought a hard case for it so I won't break the screen on this one. Hopefully people will see my review. I really like this phone.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
Works really great period if you need basic fun usage that would be the one. Very affordable and great quality,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"This is by far the worst phone ever!! Screen sensitivity is extremely slow, have to tap icons several times! Phone process everything slow, if on the phone using an app, when a call comes in a black screen shows up - it literally takes a good minute to see the number calling.

"I have never had so many problems with a smart phone. It is slow as molasses with everyday tasks and is just a nuisance to set up and use. This phone cannot handle something as basic as MMS - it cannot send or receive group texts. I've never heard of anything like that! None of the fixes I can find online remedy the problem. Did a factory reset and lost all my settings and contacts, MMS issue still not corrected. This is my first Samsung smart phone and undoubtedly my very last. Just an absolute nightmare ownership experience and because I tried everything I could to salvage this piece of garbage I missed the return deadline. Seriously, do yourself a favor and avoid this phone at all costs. Samsung is a garbage brand that makes garbage products.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
It's okay so far. I like it for the most part. I just received it a few days ago and my biggest complaint so far is the screen not being as responsive as most other Samsung phones.

There was no carrier software cluttering up the memory. The initial language was Spanish but I was able to set up the phone by choosing English language on the first screen.

Here are the things that is wrong with the product I was sent (pictures included): 1. There is somesort of weird piece of plastic sticking out from the edge of the phone screen. I tried to take it out (even with a tweezer) but it just wont come out. I can may be try to file the plastic but it has a high chance of getting the screen scratched. 2. WTH is wrong with the ear buds? OMG! The right side is only few inches long and the left one is regular length. How the heck am I supposed to use them. To use them I would have to lower down my neck to a 0° angle towards my right shoulder. Definitely not useable! 3. Are those ear buds for giants? They don't even fit and it hurts and are extremely uncomfortable because of the odd shape and size. 4. The SD card slot is working so far, but it is slanted!/bent!!

"If you want a phone that is easy to use, clear sound, beautiful pictures , stylish AND tough, great battery life and is AFFORDABLE, this is the phone for you. When my Galaxy J3 finally threw in the towel, I tried some new fangled phones, off brands promising better! Faster! Greater! Bigger!! They weren't. They blacked out, quit working for no reason, sounded bad, wouldn't charge, ... so I did what I should have done in the first place... I purchased another Samsung Galaxy Phone. I upgraded my J3 (which I dropped more times than I can remember, and in water at least 30 times😳 before it finally developed a glitch🤣) to this. NOTHING beats a Samsung Galaxy phone. They're easy to use, good cameras, excellent screen area , clear, sharp, vibrant. And tough enough. I'm hard on phones. Galaxy can take it. This is the first time I've tried an international version, and with double Sim capabilities. I turned this phone on , set it on English, put in my AT&T pre paid Sim card i had used in two of the POS phones, and that was it .. no problems at all. This Galaxy phone was well worth the money, as was my Galaxy.phone before it. It has everything that I need and then some. And at an awesome price. I dont live on my phone like a lot of folks do. But I want to be able to count on it when I need to. I wasted somewhere between four and six hundred dollars on crappie POS phones(and one with a service plan I could never quite use). They promise everything and delivered nothing. I will not make that mistake again.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"I like the finger print recogition and the feature that you can add multiple finger prints, so I have both my left and right index fingers set up to operate the device. The phone turns on from the side, but also if you place your finger on the reader in the rear, which is a natural way to hold the phone, it's turns on right away. I haven't set up the facial recognition so I can't comment on that. Using the Samsung APP ""Smart Switch"", all my data and APPs transferred to the new phone. I did have to log back in to the APP accounts on the new phone, which was a good safety feature, in my opinion, in case someone where to do it without your knowledge, they wouldn't have immediate access to your information/accounts.

"I had already purchased this phone and was very happy with it and would have given it 4 stars (camera is just OK) but I dropped it and the glass was shattered. I clicked on the ""buy it again"" button on my order page expecting to get the same phone. I did not. It looked the same but there were important differences. The first clue that something was wrong was the adapters in the box which were not compatible with any electrical outlet I have. Next, after transferring all my data I noticed several unusual things. Any app that spoke had a british accent (which I didn't mind, but seemed odd). My weather app is set to 24 hour time and no matter how often I change it to 12 hour, it always reverts back to 24 hour. The dates on my email are listed as day/month/year so that March 20th would read 20/3/20. I then discovered an insert in the instructions informing me that the phone was from India and should be activated with a sim card issued in India. If I used a sim issued from another region the phone might not function properly. I live in Pennsylvania and that is where my sim card was issued. I called customer service, explained the situation and they sent me a new phone, assuring me that my experience was a mistake that would not happen again. My 2nd new phone came, again with the weird adapters and sure enough, a card that said the phone was an Indian phone to be activated with a sim card issued in India. That phone is also going back and I have ordered a completely different phone. Read the phone description carefully before purchasing.

Absolute junk. I was locked out of phone on day 1 of recieving it. as soon as i pluged in the charger i could no longer access phone. It kept saying wrong pattern. Amazon would not refund until i returned it. So basicly youl have to buy a new phone then ask for refund or be out a phone for 2 weeks waiting on your new one to arive and waist half your months phone bill with no phone.. DO NOT BUY THIs OR ANY PHONE FROM AMAZON. Save time and money and go to a store . Im out a phone until they credit me back and that wont be until they receive item plus how long it takes to process plus the 5 -7 days till it shows up in bank.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"Wide screen clear picture. UNLOCKED PHONE. you must have a SIM card that can be adaptable TO it. Headphones are disproportionate as regards to the length of the cords. Maybe it's a feature. It will not allow audio cords to be working when hooked up. I received headphones in the package, which was cool, but one of the speakers is blown.

I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. Mine is perfect. When you load the phone for the first time it gives you the option to change from spanish to english. I loved how it could communicate with my own phone after I downloaded an app on my old phone to transfer everything from my old phone to the new one. I had even written down the apps I had figuring I would have to download them all again but I didn't have to yay!!! Someone mentioned they didn't get a manual. I did but I don't need a manual. If you have had an android before you should be able to operate this without a manual. I was pleasantly surprised to get a hands free device with my new phone and my sim card went in the same way as my other phone so I had no issues there. All and all a great phone for the price. I also bought a hard case for it so I won't break the screen on this one. Hopefully people will see my review. I really like this phone.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"Disappointed. I loved my past Samsung phones and did my research on this model. Functions are limited for a phone in this price range: shutter sound on the camera can not be turned off, subpar camera (poor focus, blurry pictures, lag), the reception is awful (drops calls when my service is solid), lag when opening and closing apps. Generally a mediocre phone. Pros: light weight, seems rugged, good battery life, charges fast, has tons of storage.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

This is one of Samsung's budget phones it's okay it's not particularly big but it's not small either the red color shines a little bit dull probably because of the plastic but it doesn't have a premium look to it if you're looking for something cheap with a premium look this isn't it as far as functionality goes fingerprint reader everything that it has works okay nothing to get excited about this is a perfect budget phone for a family member or maybe a child that needs something good they would definitely be happy with this. only problem I do have is that when I got the phone it was not sealed in plastic,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

It's okay so far. I like it for the most part. I just received it a few days ago and my biggest complaint so far is the screen not being as responsive as most other Samsung phones.

The speaker on the phone is loud that's a good thing and out did not come with all kindsof bloat ware, but I'm not to much on the fingerprint or face scanner and also the image for video playback is poor quality compared to my prepaid lg k8.

"I hate this phone. I have nothing bad to say about the seller, it arrived quickly and is what was promised. However, I find this phone absolutely maddening and have wanted to throw it or drop kick it so many times that I've lost count. The most annoying feature is it's accidental touch protection. If you set the phone down, like on a table, and you want to use it, you cannot. It will not respond to touch unless you pick it up. There is a place to turn it off in the settings, but it still does this even after you tell it not to. It is a large, heavy phone and I do not always want to hold it, I should be able to set it down and use it, but no. Accidental touch is not something I've ever even worried about with smart phones. I don't know why they felt it was a necessary feature. I used a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge for four years and switching to this phone was painful. I'm comparison, this phone is a cheap pos. I really like the Google sky map app, it won't work on this phone. After about a month of use, it's decided it doesn't work inside my house. All calls are garbled and it drops most of them. It frequently loses connection to the network when outside of the home as well. I would give it zero stars if possible. I wish I understood the difference between the s model and the a model before purchasing because I would not have bought this phone. It's become so useless after a little over a month of use that I've broken down and spent the money for an s9. I would have just bought one in the first place if I knew how cheaply made this one .was.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

Would have been 5 stars except that the phone starts in Spanish which makes a chore to initialize using a Spanish-English dictionary. Other than that it works great and has most of the bells and whistles most ordinary users need.

There was no carrier software cluttering up the memory. The initial language was Spanish but I was able to set up the phone by choosing English language on the first screen.

purchased this phone twice the first phone one we got the call quality was horrible it would scramble and drop calls constantly. When trying to call out it would take a minute or two literally before it would ring to the person you were calling. It hardly ever had service bars on it which made it even harder to communicate with someone when it finally dialed out. we thought that phone was just defective so we sent that phone back and ordered another one. Got that one in and it did the same exact thing. So we sent that one back too and are still waiting on our refund.Its a beautiful phone but not all things that are pretty are worth a crap. Its a really crappy phone. Not worth the money or the headache.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

Didn't answer my questions, and was very demeaning. While I don't regret the phone, use that extra 8 bucks to get a good sd card so you can avoid the hassle. I'll be buying a new sd card soon 🙄",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"i originally bought this phone in December 2020 and Im very surprised . This phone is so powerful and advanced . If you go to Youtube and search ""Tips and Tricks for Galaxy A10s you will be blown away! The phone also has SPLIT SCREEN FEATURE which is known to be a popular feature on the new ""S"" class galaxy's (S10,S20,S21, & Any Note editions) This phone is my LAPTOP and PHONE in one! I would have paid 500 dollars for this phone and i would still be satisfied!",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"Product is from Latin Ameica Samsung. Can't register your new product on Samsung.com, nor will Samsung U.S.A. honor warranty on this phone. :(",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"It freezes too much. Can't send more than 2-3 pics per text. Can't send video or audio longer than 10 seconds. Sends my screenshots & videos very blurry... My J3 Prime (4yr old phone) I replaced with this phone was capable of more. My Galaxy S5 6yrs ago did better. Sh¡t, even my phones from 10 years ago sent at least 1min of audio, 30sec videos, & 6pics per text. This phone is too new & nice to have these horrible qualities. RIDICULOUS! And the weather & city location stays inaccurate no matter how many times & ways I tried to adjust it. Unacceptable for a brand new phone from 2019. Best thing about this phone is the battery life. From my experience at least... It was great at 1st. After a couple weeks, every few days something new would kick in. And I periodically clean all my phones data, cache, texts, etc. Very disappointed. Especially since I bought a case & screen protectors... Replacing it with the Galaxy A71. Twice the price, but oh well. Just came out a few months ago & it's as closest I can get to a newer S series at the moment. Hopefully it doesn't let me down like this one.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

Phone was listed as new and I should have known after opening the undamaged shipping box and seeing a very damaged box withing that there would be problems. The phone was bent and dented on the back.

"I have no idea how this model got 4.5 stars. There is a defect in this model that causes the data not to work, the phonecalls stop working, the phone doesnt function if its not on wifi. You may be able to troubleshoot it but when i buy brand new technology i dont care to troubleshoot, id just like to use my product. Tied getting a replacement, same exact issues. Then the return process for the replacement was more difficult then I'd like. I'm currently waiting for a ups driver to pick up my phone when I could have just returned it with the other one to Kohl's. Absolutely no kohls drop off as an option and even though amazon gives you a time window for the ups man to arrive ups does not give out time windows whatsoever. Huge discrepancy there. As a consumer I am not happy with amazon nor am I happy with UPS. This isn't my first issue with Amazon and personally I'm beginning to feel that Amazon sucks and I'm about to choose to live without that convenience since it's no longer super convenient. They have absolutely no discourse as to when these issues arrive, no sympathies for their mistakes no sorry for the inconveniences here a percentage or a coupon, a month free for your loyalty to make up for our booboo nothing just a big fat eff you. So if you don't need me then I'll be goin",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"I have never had so many problems with a smart phone. It is slow as molasses with everyday tasks and is just a nuisance to set up and use. This phone cannot handle something as basic as MMS - it cannot send or receive group texts. I've never heard of anything like that! None of the fixes I can find online remedy the problem. Did a factory reset and lost all my settings and contacts, MMS issue still not corrected. This is my first Samsung smart phone and undoubtedly my very last. Just an absolute nightmare ownership experience and because I tried everything I could to salvage this piece of garbage I missed the return deadline. Seriously, do yourself a favor and avoid this phone at all costs. Samsung is a garbage brand that makes garbage products.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"It's got some flaws, not the best face rec or fingerprint scanner, however for the price, it's a great deal and every other task I've asked of the device has been completed flawlessly. I was worried that on 2g or RAM would be noticable as many of the newer phones come with3 or 4 now, but I have been unable to tell a difference or noticed any slowing in device performance.

Searched for verizon phones and was sold a phone that does not work on verizon at all. Purposefully misleading then steal 20% to return it. Scam,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
I am disappointed that this phone was not brand new. No where in the description does it mention that is is a pre owned or USED phone. My phone already game with someone else's information TIMTHEGAMER204@GMAIL.COM. I would like some of my money back. Why would I pay full price for something that is used and not new? I purchase pre owned items often but not for the same price as a new item. That is absurd. As a seller you should be honest. You already know this phone was pre owned. List that so as a consumer I can make my proper decision. You should make this right.,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"Me gustó mucho, la entrega muy buena .. amo Amazon 😍😍😘",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
"Absolutely the most aggravating pile of trash i have ever used. It's comparable to a defective Blu phone. I honestly didn't even finish updates before i knew i hated it. I will never buy a samsung again. Guaranteed. The price cannot be justified just because of the storage. I prefer using my broken ran over 50$ LG. The swyping is unforgivable, doesn't auto space in Google search, literally swypes words that words that doesn't exist in three English language, and oh yeah i checked and triple checked language settings spell checking. Now considering this is a phone.... i should be able to call and gave a conversation, that would be nice. However the ""sim card data has changed, device will reset automatically"" happens every 10 seconds to 2 minutes killing my service. Now. Even more embarrassing is the sound quality. Im talking my kyocera from 1999 DUMPS on this thing, so quiet sounds like only half the speakers work, they sound super chincy. Just cheap crap. On to Samsung customer service. Not good. Ima just leave it at that. Id rather blindfold myself and play in heavy high speed traffic than use this phone. I refuse to return that abomination,. it will be destroyed with 5 lbs of tannerite",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"I bought this as a replacement phone, making sure to check the description and questions to see it worked with AT&T. It does NOT. Apparently AT&T is eliminating 3G and it's system sees many older phones as 3G even if they are 4G. This is one of them. Make sure you specifically check with AT&T before you buy a phone!!!",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android
I purchased this phone as a birthday gift for my father. He's been using it for a few months now and he loves it. It's fairly simple to use and it was actually fun teaching him the new technology in them like the fingerprint reader and facial recognition.

"The phone itself seemed great but theres no sim card so, I thought an easy way to fix that would be to put my old sim card in it; however, it did not work.

The screen goes black, doesn’t let you do anything, until it ran out of battery then it could turn back on right after charging it or take a day or two to start. Seller said after the 30 day warranty they offer the window is closed with them. Then if you are outside the USA (main reason why you buy this type of phone) the manufacturer “may or may not cover the Warranty”. Seller didn't offer any type of help to get the problem resolved/fix/repair considering have been only 3 months since it was purchased. After 30 days you are OUT OF LUCK.

The cellphone overall is a very nice cellphone but it is NOT compatible with American cellphone companies. Can make calls and text. That’s it! Can use any other features.

"If you want a phone that is easy to use, clear sound, beautiful pictures , stylish AND tough, great battery life and is AFFORDABLE, this is the phone for you. When my Galaxy J3 finally threw in the towel, I tried some new fangled phones, off brands promising better! Faster! Greater! Bigger!! They weren't. They blacked out, quit working for no reason, sounded bad, wouldn't charge, ... so I did what I should have done in the first place... I purchased another Samsung Galaxy Phone. I upgraded my J3 (which I dropped more times than I can remember, and in water at least 30 times😳 before it finally developed a glitch🤣) to this. NOTHING beats a Samsung Galaxy phone. They're easy to use, good cameras, excellent screen area , clear, sharp, vibrant. And tough enough. I'm hard on phones. Galaxy can take it. This is the first time I've tried an international version, and with double Sim capabilities. I turned this phone on , set it on English, put in my AT&T pre paid Sim card i had used in two of the POS phones, and that was it .. no problems at all. This Galaxy phone was well worth the money, as was my Galaxy.phone before it. It has everything that I need and then some. And at an awesome price. I dont live on my phone like a lot of folks do. But I want to be able to count on it when I need to. I wasted somewhere between four and six hundred dollars on crappie POS phones(and one with a service plan I could never quite use).

Scrolling is nice and smooth most of the time. Colors are good. Not the most capable phone but if you want something simple cheap and big this is the right choice. Speaker is probably the only thing I would complain about. Doesn't have the best sound quality. A nice pair of galaxy buds will fix that. Blue light filter could also be better.

I bought this phone for my brother and was planning on giving to him for his birthday since his phone no longer works. Excited to get the phone so I can a surprise him when I go to see him for his birthday and inboxing the phone increased my excitement. The phone is sleek and very easy to hold; until I went to set it up. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOURE USING IT IN THE US. The Phone I received (don’t know if they’re all the same) had NO OPTION TO SELECT ENGLISH AS YOUR LANGUAGE. It starts off with Spanish and has the drop down window to select your language of choice. However NO OPTION FOR ENGLISH. Even though the description says US + International and can be used on T-Mobile network. Plus it had a lot of positive reviews I figured I couldn’t go wrong. Please do not buy if English is your first/only language and you’re planning on using it in the US,Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"Many dual SIM phones have only two card slots, one for a SIM and one that can be used for either a second SIM or a microSD card, but not both. This phone has three slots in its card tray, two for nano SIMs plus a dedicated microSD slot, so no sacrifice is necessary. Has an FM radio chip and includes wired ear buds to use as an antenna. Minimal bloatware, only thing I'd like to delete but can't is Facebook. Flashlight is super bright but only has one brightness level, 100%, unlike my previous Samsung which had four. No magnetic compass sensor, which is no biggie with GPS or if you can determine heading from the sun, moon, and time. No NFC so no support for contactless payment. Speaker location on the bottom edge to the left of the Micro USB port is unfortunate... my natural operating mode is left handed using the thumb to type and little finger to balance the phone, which blocks the speaker. Speaker is also blocked if I hold the phone against my body to stabilize. Speaker is plenty loud and sounds great. Wish it had a USB Type C port and quick charging capability. Display is very sharp, plenty bright. Software supports pretty much any language on the planet... at first turn-on, Español is the default, so pull down to US English if that's your preference. Easy peasy. No problems getting it to work on Metro by T-Mobile... just have to register the IMEI through one of their flirty customer service call center reps, who will waive the $15 fee if you go that route instead of taking it to a store. Had I asked for her number, she probably would have shot back with 611 LOL! Anyway, love the glossy red finish. 2 GB is a little light these days, but I've always used lower end phones so knowing how to minimize RAM footprint is second nature. No problems yet. Overall, not disappointed. I would buy again.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"I don't know if the issues I'm having with this phone is due to the fact that it was used or if it's because the a10s is just not a great phone. The camera and the flash are out of sync. When I need the flash to take a picture the flash goes off before the picture is taken and the picture quality is not very good. My Galaxy s9 takes great pictures. Also, I have to tap on icons several times to get the phone to react. I'm going to return this phone and buy another s9. The finger print reader works fine, the battery life is very good, and the face recognition is functional. But the other issues make this a sub par phone in my opinion.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"I don't really write reviews. This is my first long review. I spent countless hours trying to find a budget Friendly Quality phone. The camera quality is pretty great in (good lighting). I like that it has portrait mode. This phone is not small, it is just Slim but I have a phone case & screen protector. The screen is big and pretty. Ive had this phone about 2-3 months & hace dropped possibly over a handful of times and no cracks. Sound quality is okay, not the Loudest. The battery is good, it can last all day Maybe two depending on phone usage. Im on my phone frequently and last me all day if full charge. It can also take a while to charge. If you live in the U.S. you may have to call your phone carrier customer line or in store to activate your IMEI to their Network in order to get phone service. I wasted about 2 days trying to do it myself 🤦🏽‍♀️ when i couldve just called customer Service and got it activated in less than 5-10 minutes. Also this phone is compatible with MOST GSM carriers NOT all, (Ex. Metro PCS, T-Mobile). It is not compatible with CDMA carriers (Ex. Verizon, Sprint). It tells us in the description box. Most importantly review the company reviews you plan to purchase the phone from so you can have an idea of what youre getting yourself into. All in all I am highly satisfied with my phone.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

The phone takes good pics, can be personalized to your liking of course. The only negatives I've noticed thus far is that the phone was programmed in Espanol which I'm not fluent in at all. But I was able to work my through it and program it to English. Also I couldn't get the facial recognition to work when I first tried it but I'll reattempt again later.

"It is a Christmas present so I'm only rating for what I can see. I'll update later after the person gets and uses it for a little bit, so I can say Truthfully the likes/dislikes(if any). First!! I got it Super Fast! The protection filler ( for lack of a better word ), could have been a little better! It has 2 (what I call blow up pillows) One was deflated the other one was fine, but in my opinion 2 is not good enough even on regular days, much less Christmas time where things are super crazy and not handled with the best of care!( I used to work in a Post Office! AND delivered mail bags/packages to other Post Offices! SO I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT)! That being said, when I opened the package the Phone box was in pristine condition! The phone has a heavy feel to it. And that is Great by me. I hope it means it can take a beating until she picks out a case for it.LOL. The screen is a lot bigger than what she has now and bigger than I thought it would be! She has "" fingerprint reader "" on her phone now and loves it so I think I hit it out the park with fingerprint And face recognition!! I'm giving the Phone 5 stars for what I can tell as of now. Like I said I will update a little later. UPDATE: Longer than a couple of weeks ( sorry ). I have to say this is an Awesome phone!!! It is so much better than I was expecting for the price. And she has even dropped it a few times ( before she got a phone case for it ), and no damage at all!! I was floored to say the least! I expected a cracked screen or something, but nothing. So if you want a phone that has it all (in my opinion), great volume, nice feel, AND you don't have to worry about being gentle with it, then all I can say is ""I don't think you'll go wrong buying this one"" . I know I'm very grateful I did.",Samsung,Galaxy A10s,Android

"Anonymous, 01 Mar 2021I would think that those first 2 issues are what makes it not  a 'Great UI'.
If it&... moreWhat makes it an great UI you ask me? Plenty of reasons, like :
 
1. Animations and transitions in every tap, swipe, scroll gesture you make. It is very good in 90/120hz displays. You simply just notice it the difference between 90 and 60hz. Whereas stock android and oxygenos doesn't have those animations, so high refresh rates doesn't look as good as MIUI.
 
2. Plenty of customization, you can change icons, super wallpapers, themes, lock, charging/fingerprint animation
 
3. Just like the first point, every actiom you do will have an haptic feedback, yes even cheap phones from Xiaomi do. So even if the feedback isn't as good, it is still better than not getting an feedback. In Xiaomi Flagships, the feedback for every action you do even outclasses Apple's Taptic engine and Ios.
 
4. Promised Updates for at least 3 generations of MIUI (not android) no matter what phones you choose, cheap or super cheap. I mean, even Redmi Note 7 , which ships with Android 9, gets Android 11 and 3 versions of MIUI, sure you will not get Android 12, but you will later get MIUI 12.5 which is better than Oneplus giving only 1 years of updates. Even though the update is a bit slow, but still better than not getting updates. Even Realme, Oneplus, Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, Samsung entry level phones only gets one year updates.
 
4. Plenty of featues, like scollshot, screen recorder, DC dimming, vibration customization, clear speaker, and even fun ones, like an app exploding in your home screen when you delete it. 
 
5. Extreme levels of details just like Point 1 and 3. There's just so much attention to details. But at cheaper phones, this skin may be a bit too heavy for them. While on high end xiaomi phones, the UI is so awesome and also without ads (which i don't mind). The scanner app i also found it to be able to be deactivated, but i just let it on so it can continue to scan my apps from unknown sources or play store.
 
I am not an Xiaomi fanboy, i just like what i think are the best parts. And the positives of MIUI overshadows the negatives of it. Not like Huawei's EMUI and Vivo's Funtouch OS",Xiaomi,Mi 11,Android

I have played the game since the second week of launch. At version 1.0, there were not much issues with the game. My Samsung used to run at high (not highest) settings 30 frames without frame drops, at least for half an hour gameplay. There were not many bugs to start with. Same applies for my iPhone 11 where it can run at the highest, 30 despite getting very warm (because it lacks cooling). The iPhone 12 clearly had OS issues initially and hence the throttling, where many games would just stutter here and there.
 
Only then after 1.2 (Dragonspine map update) I have noticed that the game does not run normally as usual in any of my phones. Don't blame the lack of cooling, because I visited the Genshin forums in Facebook and also noticed many players having the same issue. It used to be that players with lower end chipset/phones (ex. Redmi Note 8 w/ SD 665) were able to play the game, nowadays it will just glitch and get very hot when their device specs meets the requirements. This is not fixed in 1.3.
 
I don't get the reason why you bought a Samsung S21 Ultra if you are only planning to play that single game, if you are not even a frequent gamer. Yes I am aware of the video recording issues. Don't think the SD version of the S21 Ultra is going to perform a lot better aside from cameras, just try it.

""Also no point of selling a S21 Ultra only because of that single game. You can’t be serious at all. Then what phone did you switch to?"" 
 
If Snapdragon 865 can perform better than Exynos 2100 because of Exynos gpu throttling, then I don't feel worth spending on a Exynos model. I'll happily wait for some Snapdragon 888 device. I also mentioned how video recording was terrible for whatever reasons and photo quality inferior in many cases to my wife's mi 10 ultra. Add to that slow battery charging times, I just didn't feel justified in giving €1250 to Samsung for that, consequently returned the phone.  
I am still currently on my previous Samsung Galaxy flagship. After the good reviews of MI 11,  I am waiting for Mi 11 pro or the MI 11 Ultra. 
 
""Still not answering my question which adventure rank are you and the characters you own so at least I can verify the validity of your statement."" 
 
I already told you that I am not much of a gamer, let alone playing Genshin Impact regularly. I just fired up the game on the new device since it is the most demanding title on playstore. Was excited to see how Exynos 2100 handles the most demanding game on playstore. Was dissapointed. If I am buying a flagship, I expect a flagship.

"Android-Authority, 19 Feb 2021I tested the phone myself. I don't play games much.

It’s due to poor optimisation of the game that causes the Samsung to have issues. I am a member of some Genshin groups, just check players complaining despite having a high end device. Almost all phones but those from Xiaomi (even a phone like Realme X50 Pro has issues and not all Mi phones) has issues. Then why is mine having a screen glitch? It’s obvious that the developers do not support the graphics.
 
I have decided to test the phone in other demanding games, or older titles but at highest settings. PUBG and COD Mobile will run at highest settings locked at 60 frames without any heat build up. Bright Memory Mobile does not have issues as well. Shadowgun Legends, which is very demanding, also runs well most of the time. Only few frame dips but mostly smooth overall.
 
If a game does not run well on a phone you cannot say that game is demanding. Think of Cyberpunk 2077. That game has good visuals and is requires high specs. Unfortunately this game is buggy here and there including graphics. This is why many people do not benchmark PC with this game and use something else more highly optimised, ex. Shadow of the Tomb Raider (very popular).
 
I also checked Gary Explains video about the A14 throttling test and the A14 almost doesn’t throttle whereas last iPhone 11 Pro Max with A13 throttles 15%. Last 2 years I have complained about the Speed Test G being biased but some people in GsmA insisted to me. Now that the iPhone leads they now blame the benchmark. Silly, as soon as an iPhone leads in anything they call it a biased test. 😀 I have checked other videos in that channel and most of them are very reliable.

Decided to run Genshin Impact since it is one of the most demanding titles. Exynos 2100 being a flagship chip should run it fine. Got 30-35fps at certain stages of the game and was dissapointed. Ran the same game on my wife's mi 10 ultra, it was getting 55fps and above average. Next gen chip shouldn't be struggling compared to the Snapdragon 865. Then looked up online and found that Snapdragon 888 has much better performance. Exynos scr€wed up again. The video recording was also terrible for whatever reasons. I have used Samsung flagships in the past exclusively, Samsung used to be the best at video recording. For whatever reasons, they couldn't optimize it on their own homegrown chip this year. I expected more from a phone that cost me €1250. Returned it and now I am waiting to buy something with the Snapdragon 888.
 
""My phone is using Snapdragon 865 and not Exynos 990.""
 
Read my post again, I said Galaxy S20 FE 5g. The 5g is exclusive to Snapdragon version.  
The reason why your Galaxy S20 FE with Snapdragon 865 gave low fps is because Samsung doesn't put any cooling on it. The chip is capable to give solid 60fps. They have to pair it with proper cooling. Same for the A14, it drops to 45fps average because of lack of cooling. If Apple implemented proper cooling, it would have maintained 60fps,but it doesn't in real life. 
 
Who cares about Gary Sims or some benchmark? The phone is behind in fps. 
I gave the example of wildfire benchmark to demonstrate how these benchmarks mean nothing and despite IPhone beating every other chip in benchmarks, it is struggling to go beyond 45fps because of thermal throttling. Why is there thermal throttling you ask? Because they cheapened out on the cooling. Wow what a premium brand!!!
 
""I remembered the statement that you hyped the S21 Ultra so much just because it was rumoured to score 800k in Antutu""

But you know what I found it really ironic? The Sony Xperia 1 ii, with a much smaller 4,000mAh battery and a full-on 4K screen with a static 60Hz screen refresh rate, managed to score just about the same endurance battery life as the Mi 11 also in 60Hz screen refresh rate mode. It does make me wonder if there is a battery optimization issue going on either from the chipset or from the MIUI or from both of them.

The game is more optimized for smartphones over consoles or PC. If it was that badly optimized, Snapdragon 865 phones wouldn't be getting above 50fps consistently, ROG 3 like this anonymous guy mentioned gets 58fps with last year's chip(because Asus didn't cheapen out on cooling like Apple)

"Judging from the review the Mi 10 looks like a much better value and better in some aspects, unfortunately it is no longer sold officially. The only meaningful upgrades are the screen and better macro cameras.
 
Would like GsmA to perform a stress test alongside other phones. It looks like Samsung’s 5nm foundry has messed up, therefore SD888 and Exynos 2100 has a design problem.

"""108MP sensor is more than enough for smart/magic zoom ala Pixel 5,"" 
The Pixel 5 has no magic zoom. All people who praise Google's zoom obviously never compared the zoom in a scientific way. I have Google phones and I know what I am talking about. In perfect light conditions without shadows Google's zoom has basically no advantage over conventional digital zoom or crop of a dng file. Whenever there is an advantage over a crop, it's due to the fact that Google combines more frames when you zoom, this leads to less noise and more detail in low light conditions, but doesn't work in good light conditions, no matter what Google said. Google's machine learning zoom also invents wrong detail, so it can actually perform worse than conventional digital zoom.",Xiaomi,Mi 11,Android

Samsung and Asus have more battery. the tree from BBK and xiaomi with 5000mAh for example would be able to score maybe 1h more for video and internet. 
 
** ROG obviously would score less if it had QHD. 
 
Also, the review of 21U says sometimes screen was below 60Hz. This was not noticed on Oppo. They do not know if 9P has software already to make screen go below 60Hz when there is no need of more RR.

Despite unusal battery ranking, I doubt battery will last less than twice of Samsungs in real world, day to day, as 1+ was way ahead in models 6-7-8. Look at the massive market-topping 35hr for 3G, that's what defines the standby. My 8Pro can make it to 3rd day, and I expect 9 to go even further.
 
Performance tops the markets ex gaming phones/modes easily. No Exynos tax here. 8Pro was even excellent in not-so-popular rankings like market-topping networking performance, best UFS @3.0, fast USB etc and this got improved further.

Finally, I do care about weight, and it's disappointing to see no progression here (tho it's hardly any better in other flagships nowadays). 199g->197g for 6.78""->6.7"" isn't any progress, 192g for the base model isn't delightful as it doesn't solve the problem of ""i want flagship but light"" but it's nice they purposedly didn't cripple it much (as Samsung love to do e.g. Note20).
 
I'd defly upgrade from 7 models as they were not good (display very bad, network performance, UFS, USB, cameras were all semi-flagship), but it's bit harder move from 8Pro.
 
Now for the next model, as we're slightly running out of innovations, it's time for: 
- camera under display (if 1+ was first in 90Hz and fp under screen, why not this) 
- antics back.. they will have to come back: the sd card, the notif.light and the +pen (1+version of s-pen) 
-> sd card could be a smart counter-move against S21 this year -- missed opportunity! 
-> notif.light in any form must come back and it can be even a display on the back like Xiaomi/ZFlip or a glowing logo. AOD is cluttered and shows too much, there has to be a way to know 2 simple facts: charging is ON, and you got important message (SMS, Signal) worth of picking the phone. 
-> the pen or folding.. you decide!

"Google also needs to bring back HDR+ enhanced. Night Sight takes up to approximately 6.5 seconds (without counting the processing time) (proof: see Engadget's Pixel 5 youtube review at 11:45 , I have measured the duration), by the way, that's also the case with the Pixel 3a. 
HDR+ enhanced is a fast Night Sight mode and only takes up to 2.5 seconds, if you don't zoom. Instead of an exposure time of 1/2-1s per frame, it chooses 1/5s per frame, so you get nearly always sharp photos with HDR+ enhanced whereas Night Sight often leads to slightly blurry = worse photos or you need to take the photo again, then it's basically 13s vs 2.5s (actually even more than 2x6.5s=13s because you have to check whether the image is blurry). So Google really needs to bring back HDR+ enhanced, which can nearly always produce as bright photos as Night Sight, if you use exposure compensation.

Just like desktops did, phones will start to diverge in processing power as per user needs. 
We started seeing the ""G"" branded processors, and soon that would extend to things beyond a boost in GPU clock speed: 
Think of having an Intel i7 with a integrated graphics and Intel i7 with a discrete RTX3080. 
Both are flagship chipsets, but gaming on them (for those requiring it) is a night-and-day difference. System price is quite different as well. 
Today, the SD765 is closer to an i5 with a 1050Ti, for example, and the SD865 is an i7 with RTX3080...  
Can you really say that everyone needs an i7 with RTX3080? I don't think so 
Can you not play pretty much every game out there on an i5 with GTC 1050i? of you course you could at various degrees of resolution/quality degradations.
 
Also, are there not premium laptops with i5s? sure thing 
And thus, we are now heading into this trend, and I guess we will start seeing SD8x5 and SD8x5G processors as well as SD7x5 and SD 7x5G processors powering up phones, probably even the same phone model with just the processor/memory variations.
 
Apple so far is doing the opposite with keeping the same flagship chipset and downgrading the design on its various tiers, but that too I believe will soon change; but Apple will always be Apple, they will do whatever they feel like waking up in the morning and everybody will applaud and follow :D

What on earth are you even saying? Exynos 990, despite its spotty reputation, is still powerful enough to absolutely annihilate SD765G in every single way you could imagine. It's nearly 40% faster under multi-threaded workload and packs double the graphics performance. All right, 765G is more battery friendly, sure - but that's due to the simple fact that it's FAR less powerful having 2 less performance cores that are also clocked lower than those on Exynos 990.

iPhones have nice colours (if a bit too cold and greenish in many scenario) and their night mode is easily one of the best, but the amount of compression, sharpening and local contrast boost they apply during the day are hilariously excessive and on top of that photos still look like they have come out of a small sensor like those from Pixel. As far as I could tell I don't see a whole lot of difference between 12 Pro and 11 Pro, but I guess the situation would be slightly better on 12 Pro Max that comes with the brand new 1/1.7"" sensor.",Google,Pixel 5,Android

"I'm not on par with your ""alternatives""! 
 
Also does the Oneplus Nord have more cameras, BUT yet NO Telephoto lense! You only get a telephoto lense + ultrawide + wide in the Samsung S20FE, which misses out the 5G and comes with a worse SOC at 600$ (the pixel 5 is 600$ outside the US because of the mmwave technology!)! 
Both the Nord and the FE been tested average, the nord even below average when it comes to photo quality (even if it offers a better main camera on paper). When comparing the OP 8t you also DONT get a telephoto lense and an ultra-wide with 16mp like the pixel 5 one. The OP8t with 5g is 50-100$ more expensive than the pixel 5 (matter of location). Though you get higher MP in the main camera, if you are up for that (pixel 5 still creates beter photos by software). The Nord also misses out on the Qi-charging front and has no USB 3.0 or 3.1, has gorilla glass 5 instead of 6, is made of plastic, BUT has an ultra-wide front cam.
 
You DON'T get more when choosing 400$ phones. Most phones at 400$, fake around their cameras. They are often below average but always don't offer more combinations than wide and Ultrawide, just like the Pixel 5. There is no need for 2MP Macro-Cameras or depth-cameras. Most 400$ phones offer 5g only when spending 100$ more (cept the Nord, which I already stated has bad cameras).
 
The only real alternative to the pixel 5 is the iphone 12 which is near the same size with 6,1"", better video qualities, Face unlock, mag safe accessoires, etc., but is also 100-200$ more expensive and YET does NOT offer a telephoto lense! Also the s20 FE is a true android alternative. Its also the only phone offering wide, ultrawide and telephoto in one phone sub 800$, but is much larger with 6,5"" AND it also plays around with prices. You won't get an SD865 (none +) and no 5g for 700$ - but only 4G and an much unloved Exynos chipset. And you only get a plastic back in the 700 and 800$ version.
 
Conclusion: Google packed its 5 with everything to expect from a phone sub 800$ (700$ inside US, 620$ outside US): 90hz, 5g, wireless charging, USB 3.1, bezelless design (not even a chin!), ultrawide/wide camera setup which is still one of the best, still the best night-mode, finally 4k videso at 60hz, 8GB RAM, no plastic back. Still it misses out on the front camera and the ROM offered. The missing 120hz and 6,5"" is up to you guys, most phones will operate in 60hz anyways to save battery. No game right now runs on more than 60hz on android.

It’s too expensive for this price. Don’t know what Google was thinking. Looks like a half heartedly done job. A phone launched just for the sake of it. Galaxy S20 appears a better package hands down. Pixel 5 should be a below $500 phone. ,Google,Pixel 5,Android
"It's big as my Pixel 1 that had 5"" screen ;) 
Idle battery life so far is great, good sound when taking call (a bit ""bassy"" due to the speaker being behind glass), it charges slowly when not using PD charger and the camera is good - especially when I am taking pics of my dog that is black (on a Pixel you can see fur, on Xperia it was just underexposed black painting no matter what I did ... well the only thing that fixed it was to turn on flashlight).  
I switched stereo speakers, dedicated camera button and faster SOC Xperia to Pixel, and I am perfectly OK with it, because the phone was not yet able to frustrate me as Sony often did.
 
So IMHO a good phone, not exceptional value or anything like my Realme 6 I use for work is, but the Bose headphones I will receive, will make it into even sweeter experience.

Camera is all about the software, in the Pixel 5 photos I see consistency.  Exposure, details, white balance and low light are the best I have seen.  Sure there are advantages to have a bigger sensor but there are also disadvantages like focusing.  Google has dramatically improved the battery life and video quality this year which is a big win for us.  ",Google,Pixel 5,Android

"As others have said, nothing special. It's weird that it feels like the 4a 5G would tick more boxes for someone who wants the basics (stereo speakers, headphone jack, dual cam, and solid-enough battery).
 
Google's going in the right direction. If they want to succeed next year, they should do:
 
Pixel 5a with Snapdragon 690 (makes no sense to give it the same processor as the 'flagship') 
Pixel 6 with a 775 and 6.0"" display 
Pixel 6 XL with the same as above but with a 6.7"" display
 
But the 'flagships' need to come with 3 cameras, some bezel to house dual selfie cams again, FRONT-FACING stereo speakers, and the return of unlimited cloud photos storage. Make them come with all that while pricing it well and I can see Pixel finally bringing in some solid devices.",Google,Pixel 5,Android

"Ok so.   
This particular phone is wanted for two things : Stock experience and Camera. 
So i have 2 questions for GSMarena crew: 
1) Why Pixel shots in general are in a Different location? Presumably outside Europe (Following the vivid atmosphere there) 
- Other devices like Xiaomi's or Onepluses/ Samsungs are i believe in Sofia (Bulgaria) so we can easily compare ourselves with our amateur or proficient knowledge of photography? 
2) Why there is always an underline or a biased text when reviewing a Pixel or a Google phone of the late era towards IN A NEGATIVE WAY?  
-The Subtle ""Never settle"" shirt, passively aggressive |not being impressed by anything that this device offers"" which happened way to many times in recent years.
 
Pixel 5 is a Great phone, i mean great.  
Form factor, Simplicity, Saves time and money and will be More consistent and  More secure By A MILE then other android device.

"Google hasn't brought back the white balance presets, very poor decision. More than 240 support forum users voted for the white balance presets. They simply don't listen to feedback at all. 
Google hasn't brought back HDR+ enhanced, more than 170 support forum users voted for bringing back HDR+ options. HDR+ enhanced is better than Night Sight. When you use it with exposure compensation, it is nothing else than a fast Night Sight mode. While Night Sight takes up to 7s in extreme low-light conditions, HDR+ enhanced takes up to 2.5s (or 4s if you zoom), which is more similar to Apple's night mode, which takes up to 3s by default. Night Sight also often leads to slightly blurry photos, if you don't stop breathing for 7 seconds, that's another reason why HDR+ enhanced is much better.
 
It's disappointing that there is still no periscope camera and that they even replaced tele with an ultra wide angle camera, which doesn't even have autofocus for macro photos. 
Apparently you can still not edit HDR+ raw files with the Google Photos app. As far as I know Apple's photo app will support editing raw files.
 
And of course very disappointing that they still use the Imx 363, which suffers extremely from dead pixels (tested with multiple Pixel 3a) that can not be removed with 3rd party software as Google's image processing transforms the dead pixels.",Google,Pixel 5,Android

"""Since there's no longer a telephoto camera on the Pixel 5 and the ultra-wide doesn't feature an autofocus lens, the main camera no longer has this second eye to distinguish depth""

"Good review!
 
I am coming from a pixel 2xl and struggling to decide which phone to get.
 
I love Pixel phones, simplicity and all of the Google features. Yet I love to edit video on my phone, easier for me that way. I can do so on my pixel 2xl, but it is showing its age. Wondering how the 765 can handle that sort of stuff. 
 
I am tempted by the note 20 ultra, plenty of room to edit and shoot videos, but is the camera as good? And it's also so expensive.
 
One plus 8 pro is a good compromise in price, but the camera is not as good? Or on par?

Google should use a larger sensor for the next gen. product and bring telephoto lens back, otherwise Pixel lineup will lose all the advantages they had in camera department over its rivals for years.

And the price is not too bad.  
 
I actually think Google should just keep making these midrange phones and stop competing in the flagship space where they're being outcompeted in every way.
