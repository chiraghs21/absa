    "## Importing required libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Python notebook, we will explore the exciting field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its practical applications using various libraries. NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.\n",
    "We will use NLP to extract aspect based sentiments for customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin our journey, we will import the following essential libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **pandas** (imported as `pd`): Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames that are widely used in handling textual data during NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **numpy** (imported as `np`): NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, making it invaluable for numerical processing in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **emoji**: The emoji library allows us to work with emojis within the text data. Emojis are becoming increasingly common in text communication, and this library facilitates their handling in NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **re**: The `re` module in Python stands for regular expressions. It is used for pattern matching and manipulation of strings. Regular expressions play a crucial role in preprocessing and extracting information from textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **string**: The `string` module provides various functions and constants related to string manipulation. It comes in handy when dealing with text preprocessing and filtering out unwanted characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **collections.Counter**: This class from the `collections` module is useful for counting the occurrences of elements in a collection. It is especially helpful for analyzing the frequency distribution of words in text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will dive into the world of NLP using the **spacy** library, which is a powerful and efficient NLP framework. We will leverage the `Tokenizer` from the `spacy.tokenizer` module to break down text into individual tokens or words. Furthermore, we will use the `pprint` module for pretty-printing the results and making them more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import these libraries and get started with our exploration!"

Again fooling . . . moreThe main camera is equivalent to 24mm . But it ' s actually not really a \" 10x optical zoom \" setting , because 10x optical zoom means that the focal length is 10x as high .

So the magnification is actually only 4 . 6 times as large . That ' s the reason why it needs to use a smaller sensor than the main camera . A true optical zoom setting decreases neither the sensor size nor the megapixel count . ( Though in this case , due to diffraction , only the 3x camera would have benefited from a higher megapixel count ) . Recently , a website has shown a raw file comparison in low light conditions with the S20 Ultra ( not S21 Ultra ) and has uploaded the dng files . It seems that 108 to 12 megapixel pixel binning doesn ' t work perfectly . Despite a noticeably longer exposure time , the 12 megapixel raw file didn ' t really look better than the raw file of a Xiaomi 10 Ultra , this means that the 10 Ultra should produce less noisy raw files in extremely low light conditions at the same exposure time . Also a OnePlus 8 Pro produced a noticeably less noisy dng file ( than the S20 Ultra ) with a similar exposure time .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 354: Hello Reader , First of all , I would like to clarify one thing , I bought Google Pixel 4a for one reason and one reason only , which is : To flash and try GrapheneOS and CalyxOS on Google Pixel 4a So , If you are looking for any Android phone , please think twice before buying Google Pixel 4a . I placed the order on \" Feb 4th 2021 \" , and I received it on \" Feb 7th 2021 \" , I live in Bahrain and the phone sold by \" Triplenet Pricing INC \" in USA , That was really impressive to get the phone in just two days . Pros : 1 - Very good speaker sound , for a small phone . 2 - good screen resolution and touch . 3 - good reception for carrier signal . 4 - Only Google Apps installed by default . 5 - ironically , Google Pixel devices meet the stringent privacy and security standards , that is why it ' s supported by GraphenOS and CalyxOS Cons : 1 - I consider it expensive for its HW specs , there are other good brands in the market with higher specs with same or less price with really good feel and touch and good chassis , for example : OnePlus 7 . 2 - the phone edges have air pockets , you feel it and hear sound when you softly press on the edges , the body is polycarbonate unibody , what do you expect . 3 - Forget to use the phone without an armor case and screen protector , you will lose it very quickly if you did not . Conclusion : If you are just looking for an android phone and you do not care about the brand , think twice before you buy Google Pixel 4a , you can find a better phone with same or lees price . Buy Google Pixel 4a only if you really want to , and you have your own reasons to do that , as I do .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 413: The two great things about the pixel are it ' s price point and camera . Everything else including proper camera controls was forgotten . The main issue is the screen sensitivity , I have medium sized hands and fingers ( size 9 - 10 ) and am quite adept at typing but I felt like I was losing my mind and motor skills trying not to fat finger this keyboard even at its tallest and least cluttered setting . I tried typing the same sentences on different devices and would have 4x the amount of errors on that keyboard . It does help to remove the glass screen protector but then you lose that layer of protection . Most of the new features and controls advertised are either novelties , poorly implemented , or downright dysfunctional . The gesture controls are chaotic . Basically making the entire edge of the screen a very sensitive swipe to go back which is more like the slightest touch will trigger it . Trying to scroll down through a long article . . . nope you triggered the back button and now you have to reload the page or app . Want to pass the phone to someone to show them a photo , nope either of you will likely trigger that back command and they ' ll wonder what you were trying to show them . So I switched back to the old 3 button layout but wait . . they put a button for Live Transcription right next to the Square \" Overview \" button so there have been many occasions that I unknowingly triggered it and drained my battery transcribing a walk through the woods or me muttering to myself while editing or programming . I use a lot of Google Home devices and it is getting annoying to have to avoid using the world Google like your saying Voldemort in some Rowling novel or else you get cursed with the Assistant trying to search for or make a music selection based off of a snippet of your completely unrelated conversation . Finally that lovely little camera has the worst most non - intuitive controls I have ever used on a phone . Sure you can get some great astrophotography shots but you have to turn on Night Sight mode and hope that the camera detects stars or something to trigger the mode . Yes you can ' t shoot astrophotography unless the phone thinks that is what you want . Try fighting phone controls in the late evening in 20 degree Yosemite park and you ' ll wish you had a DSLR with actual buttons so you can keep your gloves on , touch screen gloves are thin and don ' t work well due to aforementioned sensitivity issues . Switching between camera modes requires a swipe and then some have a popup so to go from Portrait mode to Slow - mo you have to carefully swipe over a couple icons and then touch one of the options that appears above video all with a very temperamental screen . It is not fun especially when your cat is being adorable and you miss shots . I also have a feeling this phone will be quickly unsupported by Google as they are already releasing things for the 5 and 5g models that aren ' t available for this one . Then it seems like they are randomly and silently removing features as well . For now I am going back to my old phone ( a very unsupported , cracked , and dull LG G6 ) and now being both burnt out from the new Pixel / Android mobiles and the IOS options , I may just relieve myself of the burden of carrying a smart phone and go for a simpler approach .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 415: The last year or so has been a concern for me because I was afraid the mid - range phone I bought three years ago would break . The new offerings have not been compelling , mainly offering better cameras but not significantly stronger processing and smaller manufacturing processes ( e . g . 7nm ) . That has changed just in the past few months and even days as there are now at least three compelling mid - range phones . I bought the Pixel 4a because it was : ( 1 ) One of the least expensive ; ( 2 ) Offers one of the best OS upgrade / update policies ; and ( 3 ) Is not made in China or by a Chinese firm - - pick your reason not to like China right now - - there are at least four . There are things I wish it had , primarily microSD and a SD 765G processor , but the 730 is plenty fast . IMHO , we ' re well past the stage where most people have any real need for flagship processors ( gamers excluded ) I ' ll upgrade my wife ' s phone to 5G later , we would mainly need that for tethering , and we don ' t both need it . It will probably be the 5G version of the Pixel 4a or the Samsung 51 . The packaging is fairly basic , containing the phone , a 120 volt charging block , USB - C cable and a sim tool . Also , it has a very useful adaptor from the large plug USB to USB - C . That is given to help connect to your old phone , but is also useful for Yubi security keys . The phone came roughly 60 % charged and didn ' t require any security updates that I noticed , having Android 10 installed with security updates current to within 15 days ( which makes me think I missed a security update being installed ) . As to the phone , it ' s roughly the same size as what I ' m used to coming from a Moto 5G Plus , but it is slightly narrower . Overall I like the change . I have not noticed any lag , and overall the phone seems very responsive , as it should coming from a phone that is over three years old in design . I wasn ' t sure I ' d like the fingerprint scanner on the back , but that has been fine . Setting up was a bit more difficult in that the automatic transfer process the phone tries to start apparently did not work at all , or maybe I ' m just not patient enough . My old phone said \" preparing \" for over 20 minutes without any indication of progress on either phone . Setting up the old fashioned way was very quick , with my roughly 150 apps installing quickly . The only problem I ' ve had is related to my Google Suite Account , which in the newer version of Android becomes a work account . That keeps me from signing into Google maps with that account , which I ' m still trying to work around . If you don ' t have a paid Google Suite Account this shouldn ' t be an issue . I also had to change a few of the default settings , but surprisingly few . I turned off a few things to save battery life , such as monitoring for songs in the background , and turned on the virtual navigation keys at the bottom of the screen , which I prefer to their gestures system . Too early to say anything about battery life because my use of the phone has been far from normal . I ' ll report back if it can ' t get through a normal day with at least 25 % of battery left .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 450: Though I ' ve only had this Pixel 4a a few days , it has been great so far . The phone came roughly 60 % charged and , as far as I can see , didn ' t require any security updates right away . I was able to open the box and start set - up right away without waiting for charging . The instructions for set - up were good . The box has the cord thingy so you can easily transfer everything from your old Pixel phone to the new one in about 15 minutes or less . It also included a little tool thingy to help get the SIM card out . This was a nice and unexpected bonus that saved a lot of grief . The transfer of everything from the old Pixel to the 4a was smooth and didn ’ t take a ton of time ; the most frustrating part is having to remember your google password , and any other passwords for apps you had on the previous phone . Also some settings needed to be readjusted . As of now , I don ' t seem to have lost anything , though 8 of my contacts transferred without the names . To clarify : the numbers were there in recent texts without a name attached to them but I was able to read the previous texts and determine whose number it was so I could add them as a new contact by using the 3 little vertical dot thingys on each text . I loved my flagship Pixel but knew I needed a new one because the old one wasn ' t being supported anymore and performance was getting slower . I chose the Pixel 4a largely due to the fact that the Pixels don ' t have all the bloatware that comes with Samsung and other brands . I don ' t use FB or Twitter or a lot of those other apps that take up space and not having these unneeded apps on my phone was a huge deal for me . I like having it be our choice whether to put an app on my phone rather than having these forced on us . I also like the Google Keep for notes and the Google Calendar since I had these on previous phones and everything transferred to this Pixel 4a smoothly . Another good factor is the price of the 4a ( this was significant in our decision ) , particularly because it seems to have everything I need and not a bunch of stuff I don ' t need or want . An additional plus is the larger screen ( no bezel ) while still keeping the small size of the phone . The screen looks classy and it ' s small enough to not be a problem getting in and out of a pocket or purse . Everything is faster and smoother than the old Pixel . The plastic hardware isn ' t a big deal to me because I use a solid wallet - case for my phones so protection is provided & people don ' t see the outside of the phone anyway . There are a few nice , new ' bells and whistles ' to learn if you are going from an older Pixel but they are good things and nothing to cause great frustration so far . I ' m still struggling a little with the gesture thingy - and how to double - tap to get recently used apps to come up so we can close them all out . I liked the way we did it on the old Pixel better - but I am adjusting . I ’ m also noticing that the new camera seems to be saving 2 of every cameral shot ( supposedly one is for editing ) and this is annoying because they take up extra space and we rarely edit our photos , so we have to delete the duplicate almost every time . I sure hope Google photos fixes this issue soon . I ’ m hoping this review might help others who are considering an upgrade to the Pixel 4a . Overall , the upgrade from the flagship Pixel ( or Pixel One , or whatever they call it now ) appears to have been a good move .\n",

Battery life is good , camera is nice , it works as a smartphone , I like that it still has a headphone jack , but I expected more . The screen doesn ' t always respond ( I try to expand from my home screen to view all apps , but it won ' t expand ) . I ' ve already had to force restart it when it got stuck in an infinite startup loop ( had it for only a month ) . I trained \" ok google \" for my voice , but it never works , however when I was listening to an audiobook in the car , for some reason the name \" Able \" activated google voice every time - super annoying . The first day , the alarm clock didn ' t go off ( found out this is a known issue ) , and I was late for work . The top volume on the speaker is laughably quiet , so don ' t expect to be able to talk on speakerphone in the car . I can ' t seem to configure my work and personal stuff to be on the same screen ( it forces me to segment them , so I have two gmail apps and two calendar apps - might be cool for some folks , but I don ' t like it ) . The fingerprint reader is on the back of the phone for your pointer finger , which isn ' t ergonomic at all . Google maps is slow to respond to route changes . I ' m not a die hard Apple person , but I ' ve found the iphone SE from years ago to be superior in nearly every way . In 2020 at this price point from Google , I expected more , now I ' m stuck .

My old phone was slow and froze frequently within the first few months of having it , but the Pixel 4a has none of those problems ! The camera is amazing , and has a lot of great settings and options . I will attach a regular picture and a portrait mode picture to show the clarity and great quality . The camera is also quickly accessable by double tapping the lock button on the side of the phone . I noticed that Google Duo has a share screen feature that is available on the Pixel 4a , but not a lot of other phones , and I enjoy having that option . The fingerprint reader works great . The battery lasts a very long time . I use my phone very frequently and usually charge it to 70 or 80 % to preserve battery life . Even with all the usage , I usually only have to charge it once a day . It would definitely take a while to die with a full charge so no worries there . The thing I came across the most while researching the phone prior to purchasing was \" it ' s a great budget phone \" and I 100 % agree . I ' m no tech expert , but as a regular user , I can say this is the best phone I have ever had . In comparison with the Pixel 4 ( which I do not have ) , the Pixel 4a does have a headphone jack , but does not have wireless charging or the squeeze feature , and is not water - resistant . I have the phone in \" Just Black \" and it is very nice and sleek with a white lock button . There were originally no navigation buttons and the phone directed me to use gestures but I was able to get the navigation buttons that I prefer in the settings .

Processing power - wise it was a down grade but bought this phone because my pixel 3 was starting to stutter at times and I just loved the way the display on the Pixel 4a looked . After receiving the phone - the phone felt really nice on the hands : outer plastic shell didn ' t feel cheap nor plasticky as many youtube reviewers stated ( feels solid to me atleast ) . Also the curvature of the side well complimented the gesture navigation ( going back gesture ) . - full display mode on youtube is awesome as expected ( the bottom left punch hole is rarely noticeable due to its position in horizontal mode ) . Although the space between the top edge of the display and the status bar is quite noticable and would ' ve been better if the gap was shorter . - also the display brightness seems slightly lower than the pixel 3 but nothing serious . - haptics feels identical to the Pixel 3 and happy that google did not cheap on this part . - apps not supporting the display ratio / size has a slim cutoff on the bottom of the display . Also , the status bar part is unutilised on all apps , which is a bummer but again not critical . - photo takes a split second more to process / save right after taking one , but besides this occasion I don ' t feel any noticeable processing speed difference on daily tasks compared to the Pixel 3 ( probably gaming will feel materially different but personally I don ' t game with my phone so no complaints on processing power ) .

My last HTC10 went through 3 batteries before I finally cracked the screen and had to buy a new phone . I had been eyeballing the pixels for a while because they don ' t have all the carrier bloat and pre - loaded apps . I was pleasantly surprised to find this had just android with no third party apps burned into the rom . The setup was easy and pulled data from my old phone as well as all the updated versions of the apps from my old phone Battery life is just crazy . The phone came with about 60 % charge . The included fast charger topped it off pretty fast . I wanted to condition the battery by running it way down before recharging a few times . I was kinda shocked that it took almost 3 days to get the phone down to < 30 % with my typical usage . Adaptive battery is on by default , and I typically have about 3 hours of screen time per day , and it hasn ' t had me searching for a charger once . This phone was advertised as having an all day battery and I ' m sure it is true for heavy users . But for those that aren ' t on social media all day , this thing will be running for at least 2 days before you have to charge it . The battery life is just awesome . Also , in the first week my phone took 1 major and 2 minor updates which was nice . All my previous carrier phones would get at most 2 updates over their lives .

I need to wait a few minutes to see the image . Even if I see the image , it is blurred and out of focus , and it will get stuck immediately . This makes me very bad for the pixel 4a . I think the core advantage of the pixel 4a as a cheap phone is that its \u001b[32m<camera function:Positive Confidence:0.628>\u001b[0m is comparable to flagship phones .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 547: I have always had expensive iPhones ( over $ 1 K ) , but now that I am retired I cannot afford that kind of money for a phone . I am also totally SICK of Apple , as their security on phones and iCloud is so extreme and bizarre that I have wasted many hours on their help line . Did you know that if Apple mistakingly thinks you are in Hong Kong , they will change your entire phone to traditional Chinese ? That took me 5 hours on the phone to rectify . And puzzles me . . . even if I WAS suddenly in Hong Kong , I would NOT suddenly start reading and speaking in traditional Chinese . In any event , I could not take the stress any more , so I decided to take the BIG step of divorcing Apple and moving to Android . I expected to have a big learning curve , but I just watched a few YouTube videos , and the transition was seamless . Within 24 hours I was IN LOVE with this phone . The screen is gorgeous , the speed is more than good enough , the battery life is awesome , and the apps are marvelous . It can do EVERYTHING my iPhones used to do . The difference is that downloading my photos to my computer is easy and a sheer pleasure . I NEVER get locked out because , for example , I have travelled to Mexico and suddenly Apple is suspicious of me . Oh , and the camera is super important to me . That is why , after a lot of research , I chose this particular phone . Well , the camera is outstandingly excellent . I am thrilled about the astral photography . For a third of the price I paid for my iPhone 6 , I now have a camera that is about 3x better . I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone - the best one I have ever had in my life . And this is coming from someone who has had decades of flagship phones from Apple . I feel sorry for all those who still think that nothing but an iPhone would do . I would rather go back to pay phones than ever own an iPhone again .\n",

The notification system is stupid . When someone text me and I respond to it from the notification window the text remains there in the notifications . If I ' m the last person to respond why do I need to see my own . message in the notifications ? ? That ' s stupid ! If I respond the notification needs to go away ! If get a bunch of notifications ( emails , text ) and I swipe them away , more notifications show up IMMEDIATELY . Sometimes they aren ' t even new . I literally have to press \" clear all \" 3x for the notifications to go away . I also don ' t like that if I ' m on a website that I ' m trying to upload a image to , the phone sends you on a wild goose chase to find your \" gallery \" . By default it brings up \" recent images \" and I think that ' s dumb . You should be able to choose what it defaults to . Even still when you press on \" camera \" it ' ll still take you to another screen that you have to press \" camera \" again just to get to the images you took with your camera . These things can be fixed with software but it ' s super annoying , especiy the notifications . Not to mention I bought a fossil smart watch that runs wear OS and if I check a email from last year , the watch will send me a notification from that email like I just received it ! STUPID !

For $ 349 it ' s a NO BRAINER . * I have used several Android phones ( including flagship ones that cost $ 900 + ) and I ' ve also used an iPhone . But this Pixel 4a is the absolute best overall experience I ' ve ever had with any phone . I ' m a tech guy for a living , so I needed a phone that could do everything and do it well , this phone more than delivered ! Did I mention it ' s ONLY $ 349 ? Below is a pros and cons list I ' ve made for potential buyers . I hope you find it helpful ! Pros : Fully unlocked so it will work with EVERY SINGLE carrier in the USA ( As well as many outside the US ) , HUGE amount of built in storage of 128GB , plenty of RAM at 6GB , a fast and energy efficient processor ( SD 730G ) , a bright and beautiful 5 . 8 inch display ( OLED at 1080p + resolution ) , a headphone jack ! ( For those of us who still prefer a wired connection ) , a decent sized battery ( 3100 + mah ) that gives you all day battery with moderate to heavy use , fast charging included in the box ( 18W ) you get from empty to 100 % in about an hour and a half , with close to 50 % after 20 mins give or take , dual stereo speakers that sound great , a very good hapitic feedback engine when you type , a phenomenal front and rear camera ( literally the best camera on any Android phone ) , really premium feeling polycarbonate ( plastic ) body , really sturdy and clicky buttons , and the absolute best software experience by Google with at least 3 major Android OS upgrades in the future . Cons : No water or dust proofing , no wireless charging , only available in Just Black color , no 5G support , limited case selection ( As of right now but that will change in the future ) . Overall , the experience of using this phone is fast , fluid , and enjoyable . The screen is bright and almost edge to edge , it ' s the perfect size for one handed use , the Pixel version of Android is light and easy to use and has many really good exclusive features like \" Now playing \" and \" Live transcribe \" as well as many more new features to come with the newest version of Android and security patches being pushed out directly from Google to their Pixel line of phones . It offers unmatched support and longevity for Android updates and security patches . I ' ve had this phone for several days and it ' s my daily driver , I have had no issues or complaints with it at all . The battery life is great , it ' s super fast and smooth , it doesn ' t slow down or stutter when I use multiple apps at a time , it doesn ' t close my apps down in the background too quickly , and it ' s the perfect size for my hands and pockets . What else can I say ? You don ' t need to spend $ 900 + to get a really good phone ! Just spend $ 349 and get this phone ! You won ' t regret it .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 577: I bought this on a whim after using various Galaxy phones since 2013 . Being very adjusted to that version of Android OS that Galaxy uses , it ' s weird at first to see Google ' s take on an Android OS but after only about an hour or two , it ' s pretty convenient in this phone . My least favorite part about getting a new phone is transferring all my previous data to a new device , but Android to Android makes this process so streamlined , I had all my music , photos , apps , wallpapers , and smaller settings in about 15 minutes from when I first booted the phone up . A few things I think that makes this device stand out is that it ' s like an iPhone XS with an Android OS running it . The display is clear and sharp , the touch is consistent , the camera is superb for the price that you pay , and the software is rather simple and clean to use . If you ' re concerned about the punch - out camera in the top left of the screen like I was , don ' t worry . It ' s barely noticeable when using the device like normal . This phone ' s size is pretty comfortable when it comes to one handed use . The matte finish on the back side gives the device a nice feel when it ' s being used . So far , I really like my Pixel 4a and I ' m happy I jumped ship . If you ' re someone who wants a phone for more basic tasks while being streamlined , then pick this up and give it a go , you won ' t be disappointed .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 578: So I have had zero issues with the fingerprint reader . It is actually been really good for letting me in and nobody else in . I even put a case on mine and I can still reach the finger reader so I actually think it ' s really great it ' s much easier for me to get into my phone compared to my old one . What I like about this phone too is that it is thinner . I used to have the Moto x charge and that was definitely much wider and I didn ' t realize how much more uncomfortable it is . Now when I pick that one up to try and compare to this one it ' s such a beast in such a tank . Whereas this new phone it ' s thinner and slimmer and can actually like fit in my palm so it ' s in my hand and then it can sit nicely on my finger like if I ' m holding it like cut . Which is very nice and I can reach everything on it with my thumb . The fact that the screen is the entire phone face is still giving me the exact same size as my old phone just I no longer have a big phone because it didn ' t take up the whole screen it had sides on it before so I really like that this one is the whole screen and that it ' s slimmer . I have a nice case on it and I have a screen protector on the front and I ' m still able to use everything the same and everything is functioning fine . My only thing is yes the battery does last all day , my old phone my battery could last a couple days but it was an ex - charge and the battery was supposed to do that . But the bonus about this phone here is it does tell me if I keep continuing using it at the rate that I am it tells me about when my phone will die the estimated die time for the battery . So that ' s easy for me to be like oh okay well I ' m going to be going and doing this so maybe I should charge it now . But I typically only charge it at night when I ' m going to sleep . it does have a spam detection for calls which I didn ' t realize was a thing and I ' ve had a couple phone calls like pop up but never ring and then they go away and I am notified that they were spam and then I have verified and they actually are indeed spam . So that has been really nice . I also like that I can give names to my group chats . Everything seems to be running very smoothly and fast at least faster than what I ' m used to . it did take a little getting used to for me to do the back button cuz there was no back button I couldn ' t figure it out but if you just hold off to the side a little bit it is actually much easier to go back and forth between things I ' ve found . my screen now has five icons across compared to my old one that had only four icons across so for me that ' s fine because I can see them fine I haven ' t looked to see if I can change that . So if you are maybe hard on seeing that might not be a benefit but otherwise for me since I don ' t have that problem this is great I really also like that I can just click on the time and date on the phone and it pulls up my calendar or the weather I don ' t have to go search for a different app I just click on it on my phone and it just takes me to that app . my other favorite thing is that it is still an Android phone I absolutely love the Android app I even have my tablets in Android because I ' m just so used to Android and I prefer Android over the counterpart . Like I really dislike Apple and Apple I think is so much more expensive . another fun thing is the night mode I set a bedtime for me and when it ' s my bedtime if I ' m staying up it goes into a black and white scale mode so everything is in black and white so then I go all right fine yep it ' s bedtime . I also like the do not disturb because I can have things blocked for when I ' m sleeping so my phone isn ' t ringing or anything and I don ' t have to remember to put it on silent it was automatically does that . Unless of course it ' s emergency it is set to if somebody calls back within a 10 - 15 minute window that it will ring because it ' s a priority call and I have that turned on . I haven ' t even come close to using all the storage space that I have on my phone . Whereas my old phone I was constantly having to delete things to get a new app if I wanted to and it was very hard to do , so I like the extra space I like how fast it works and I like the thinness of it actually . As for phone calls and stuff I don ' t have an issue with the speaker or the earpiece very simple to use and my camera is still working nicely I I still get really nice pictures . this one does say that it ' s for all carriers and I have Xfinity mobile , and when I got the phone I checked the number against their oh is your phone compatible on the website and it wasn ' t . I was very frustrated I even set up to start a new return with this but then , I was on with the people on chat and I was trying to figure it out and I even said I was going to try and go somewhere else . But here ' s the thing even though that they wouldn ' t help me and they kind of have some sucky customer service . I have a very cheap bill with them I just have to have my cable with them to get them and then each month it ' s just I think it ' s like $ 12 per gigabyte of data that you use and since I don ' t use data I don ' t have a bill each month because my phone is paid off I have nothing else going on there so I have a really great deal with them so I want to keep with them so . So before I decided to actually ship it back I pulled my chip card out of my old phone and slid it into this one here and eureka ! My phone actually works really well I didn ' t have to change anything with my carrier all I had to do was change my SIM card and the phone is compatible even if they tell you it ' s not compatible So I would say give that a try if you do have Xfinity , and then if it works great if not I ' m sorry you ' ll have to look for something else considering the stage shouldn ' t work but mine works and I ' ve been doing it for two months now and haven ' t had any disruptions with my service everything has been great and I haven ' t had to change my billing at all so I have really enjoyed having this phone .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 593: I got this to replace an aging Note 5 , which itself was a replacement for a Nexus 5 . I never quite felt like the Samsung version of android was something I enjoyed , and I was looking forward to returning to the stock experience I had with the N5 , and this one fit the bill . Sure , it doesn ' t have a few features I was hoping it had , but the honest truth is . . . did I really need them ? For the price ( $ 350 at the time of this review ) there simply isn ' t anything remotely close in my opinion , and I am truly enjoying the experience with this . The fingerprint reader is just practically instant , and the placement on the back is the right place for it . I always hated the Samsung ' s button fingerprint reader , and it seemed like a crap - shoot whether it would work or not . this one is just darn solid . Camera is great , and the battery life is just unbelievable . Unless you - absolutely - need some of the missing features , like the wireless charging , wide - angle camera or the faster - refresh rate , then this is the one to get . If you do feel like you need those , do make sure you ask yourself if they are worth paying over 2x the cost of this phone for them . . . This isn ' t just a great phone for $ 350 , it is a great phone full stop , and if this is the feature set and performance I can now expect at this price point , I will never shell out $ 1k + for a phone ever again . I didn ' t get it through amazon as it was sold out , but I also got the google branded case and that one is also fantastic and highly recommended .

They are both great phones without bloatware , and top of their relative classes , but I ' m very happy I paid more for the Pixel 4a . It ' s smaller , lighter , way better camera , better hardware , more software / security updates , and I prefer Google apps anyway . It has more features than I ' ll use , but not a ridiculous amount like on the Samsung Galaxy S4 I had years ago . I was nervous about battery life , just because I ' m used to having a phone with a ridiculous battery , but there are so many settings that extend your battery life on this phone . There ' s a battery saver mode AND an extreme battery saver mode ! I want this phone to last as many years as possible , so I use the extreme mode all the time time . I don ' t have to charge it but once every 1 - 3 days . If I used the phone more I would probably have to charge it once a day . I like I can unpause specific apps , while leaving the rest in battery save mode . I was nervous about buying a used ( not renewed ) phone on Amazon , especially because the one I purchased was only considered in \" good condition , with minor scratches on front , back , and sides \" . The phone I received is nearly flawless ! I actually didn ' t notice the incredibly minute scratches on the left side , and bottom right corner of the screen for at least 30 minutes out of the box . They ' re so small I thought they were dust . There are no marks on the back or sides at all . I couldn ' t be happier with this phone and I ' m so glad I saved some money buying it used . I can ' t speak for longevity , but my bank gives me a 2yr warranty past a phone ' s release date , and the Pixel only came out Aug 2020 . Seriously get this phone if you like smaller phones , if you need a cheaper phone , I would get the Moto G Power ( 2020 version only ! ) in a heartbeat .\n",

You MUST stay still and tilt for it to attempt a photo - The phone lags and glitches often when deleting a photo or switching from camera mode to video mode - Google Photos is the only app that comes installed for viewing / managing photos ; there is no other image gallery Also - Google just updated app icons so they all look similar to each other and very different from what they were , making everything Google less accessible , more difficult to find . No settings to change app icons back to old version . No setting to change the battery icon to say percentage - hard to read the tiny battery symbol Pros - - regular camera is fine , night mode is cool I guess - not having bloat ware , having control over what apps I have or don ' t have is nice .

The only complaint I have is the \u001b[31m<buttons:Negative Confidence:0.9971>\u001b[0m are set too low on the right edge and hard to avoid when holding the phone . Minor problem . I picked this phone because of the excellent \u001b[32m<camera:Positive Confidence:0.9927>\u001b[0m and the good \u001b[32m<price:Positive Confidence:0.9895>\u001b[0m . I ’ m very happy with it .\n",

I ' m aware that this is a bargain phone because it ' s so cheap but to me , this is unacceptable in a smartphone . My iPhone 7 before this lasted for 3 years without a case and dropping it many times from taller heights without any issue . Clearly poorly made . In addition , Google was not helpful and said they would not pay the $ 130 to fix it . Poor \u001b[31m<customer service:Negative Confidence:0.9988>\u001b[0m - never had any experience like this with Apple .

I ' m 60 and now need to use reading glasses so a larger screen on my aging eyes is a definite must for me . If you have smaller hands and don ' t mind a small screen this is a great device .

I did a month worth of research on finding the perfect budget phone for myself . Everything was pointing to the pixel 4a . I unfortunately didn ' t do enough research with my last phone which was the moto g7 . I absolutely loved the g5 and just assumed I would love that one as well , and no I didn ' t . So this was like a really nice upgrade for me . I usually use a phone for at least 2 years and couldn ' t get past a year with that one . So I ' m a heavy phone user from streaming , games here and there , camera and social media . I ' m not some tech genius but I do my research . Let me tell you some things I love about this phone . Standout Pros - - The price ! - The camera , it ' s absolutely fantastic . I can ' t get over how much I love it . My photos on my old phone were terrible . Now I can ' t stop taking pics . - Minimal bloatware . Not a whole lot is preloaded onto this phone which is great . - How light it is . Old phone was so heavy my hand would fall asleep . This is a great weight . - The features , I love some of the great things this phone can do . Such as the picking up of music around you . There are a bunch of things I really enjoy but just go watch a good review on youtube if you want to see them all . Cons - - Extremely crappy case selection lol . Literally that ' s the only con I have so far and it ' s a small one . Although I do have to say that everyone was raving about the pixel 4a ' s battery life . And I have to say it ' s pretty good . It ' s about the same as my old phone . It ' s not insane as I thought it was going to be . It ' s not a con because it ' s not bad in any way . Just thought I would mention it ' s not as mind blowing as it was made out to be . Also I thought I ' d mention that my old phone had a 6 . 2 inch screen and this is obviously smaller . I don ' t even miss or notice the smaller screen . I was a little hesitant on the smaller screen of the pixel . But almost immediately I didn ' t even notice the difference . I actually enjoy having a slightly smaller phone . The shipping was great from this seller as well . These were just a few Standout things from an average person like me . I use my phone for absolutely everything and a quality phone is extremely important . I look forward to using this phone for 2 + years at least . I hope some of this helps anyone on the fence !\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 671: I love this phone . Please keep in mind , I ' ve never owned a flagship phone , usually sticking to phones I could buy outright for less than $ 200 . That said , I was ready for a new phone and did a lot of research . I also had a chance to spend some time with a Pixel 4 to compare it . So the following are my impressions : First off , what ' s different from the Pixel 4 : You are missing the aluminum frame , the facial recognition , the edge squeeze , the water resistance , a specific camera lens and some camera features , wireless charging , and an 800 series processor . I think that ' s about it . The thing is , other than the water resistance , I personally don ' t miss any of that . What you get in return is a slightly bigger screen , a better battery , and a brighter screen ( you have to use adaptive brightness for it to work ) . This is also a fair bit lighter . Also a personal preference is that I prefer the fingerprint reader over facial recognition . For me it ' s the perfect little phone . Full disclosure , I paid about $ 260 since I bought it from Amazon Warehouse . Nonetheless , this phone hits all the right spots for me . It is light , it has a clear and bright screen , it is fast , takes amazing pictures , it isn ' t bloated with preinstalled apps , and is future proof in that you can update for 3 years , the sound is pretty great , and honestly I can ' t find much to complain about . The only thing I wish this had was the water resistance . Accidents happen . Also keep in mind that this is plastic with an outdated Guerilla 3 screen . Buy a case . Buy a screen protector . If you do , I can ' t see why this phone won ' t be a great phone for you unless you only buy the $ 1000 flagships with all the bells and whistles , in which case , why are you even reading this review ? One last thought . The battery is fine by me . I can make it through the day and longer with moderate use . No wireless charging , but it charges from zero to full in pretty much less than an hour , so I always find time within the day to plug it in and then I ' m good to go . Usually at dinner time or whatever when I don ' t want to be disturbed anyway . Had a chance to to go with the Pixel 4 , chose to go with this instead ( mostly because the Pixel 4 screen is waaaaay to dim ) . Thanks Google for this amazing cheap phone !\n",

Overall , a Good cheaper iphone alternative . Basic phone Setup took less than 10minutes . I simply took the simcard out his old phone and popped it into the pixel 4a . He uses consumer cellular . He says it works great . I noticed he needs the email account setup to access apps in the play store , however . Will update this review with any more information as time passes .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 676: I originally had a Pixel 3a for a year but decided to sell it in May 2020 to try something else . I went to a Xiaomi Note 9 Pro , Samsung S20 FE , Realme 6 Pro , Samsung S20 FE again , and now the Pixel 4a . I could have avoided all of those phones if I just stuck with Pixel . The instant security and OS updates , compact form factor , ease of flashing custom ROMs and reverting back to stock with Google ' s online tool , excellent battery life , and bloat free , fast software experience are what make Pixel the best . I commonly get 6 . 5hrs screen on time with auto brightness and light theme on . Although I really enjoyed the Xiaomi and Realme , they do not support VoLTE and WiFi calling in the US with US carriers . Samsung even though they have the best hardware , OneUI is by far my least favorite Android skin . I was GLAD to lose the superior screen , speakers , 5G , 120Hz , and WiFi 6 on the S20 FE to go to the lesser Pixel because the software experience is just that much faster and better . I forgot how much faster and more accurate physical fingerprint readers were compared to the in screen ones . Pixel 4a is definitely the phone you should go for . In my experience , 5G in my area is really not better , if not worse than 4G LTE especially since the 5G in my area is low band non stand alone . The 5G speeds were the same as 4G and I experienced higher latency in certain areas . For this reason I ' d choose the 4a over the 4a 5G unless you want the bigger screen . The 4a should have been $ 299 to compete more with the OnePlus Nord N10 but the extra $ 50 is well worth it for the longer software support Pixel provides . Overall an excellent phone and I HIGHLY recommend it after having used most major phone brands within a short period of time .\n",

This is a \" typical \" Google \" nerd \" phone that is designed for techies , not for \" normal \" older users . Camera is great I guess - - use it about once every month - - I have cameras . Battery and charging are excellent . Non - standard USB cord provided - - need to buy others for car , etc . Big problem has been phone never rings , or when it does , it impossible to \" swipe \" to open . Bad notifications ( none ) Never know when messages or voice mail is received - - have to manually check . Google continually send automatic notices and pop - ups to sell more products - - can ' t turn off . When you turn off one function , it will normally turn OFF others , e . g . , sound , so you never get notices of calls . Biggest advantage is that it is a smaller phone , 5 + by 2 + inches , easier to carry than the nerd 7 \" X 3 \" monsters . I bought it partly for blue - tooth connectivity , which is OK . My LG was 100 % more user friendly . I had bought the Apple LS , but it died within a week , so I went back to Android - - Big Mistake . Now have to eat $ 500 to change , LG does not make the small phone anymore . No one does it seems . My phone hone is used primarily for calls .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 696: I bought the Pixel 4A ( Not the 4A 5G ) to replace a older HTC model which is no longer being updated . Before buying it I looked at other phones and found that most didn ' t get regular OS or Security updates or if they did it was months after the update became available which makes me nervous . When looking at a lot of the other phones I found that most came with built in apps that quite frankly I would never use and more often than not you couldn ' t un install which I don ' t like one bit . The Pixel 4A came with a lot of google apps ( Most of which can be uninstalled which is a breath of fresh air ) and the apps that can ' t be uninstalled like Google assistant ( Which is part of the OS ) can be completely turned off unlike some other assistant apps from other companies which really helps preserve my privacy . I am extremely pleased and pleasantly surprised with the ability to turn things off or uninstall the apps I don ' t want . Unlike many people I don ' t use my phone a lot so I only have to charge it twice a week so batterie life is great ! The phone has worked perfectly since I got it and Over all I am extremely pleased with the purchase ! ! I would definitely reccomend this phone to anyone !\n",

The phone is extremely sensitive to the presence of moisture , and for many of us , it has died in circumstances that any other phone would do just fine in .

The Pixel 4a came with Android 10 and has already updated to 11 . Display is good , even in sunlight where cheap phones may not be . The speakers do not rival $ 800 phones , but they are very good sounding compared to $ 100 - 250 phones ; much better than the rear firing speakers I was used too . Bluetooth and wireless signal and sound quality are strong as well , with better speed on wireless . . The single lens camera is great for low light and sharp images in . raw or standard . jpeg like most folks use - far superior color , sharpness , and exposure than other phones also rated at 12 MP - but note that you can ' t adjust the shutter speed or f stop like a S20FE or S10 - but I really don ' t need three lenses , I have a dslr for that . There ' s an 8mp front camera that performs well too . There ' s no SD card slot , and I initially thought that was a minus since I use a 64GB SD for music .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 741: This phone was purchased after extensive research and positive first hand experience with the Pixel 3a . After several weeks of waiting for the new phone to ship after it was released , I am very pleased with the functionality of this new Pixel 4a . One of the biggest selling points for this phone is the price . I didn ’ t want to finance another $ 800 phone from Verizon so I opted for an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network . This phone was a bargain at $ 349 , but there is nothing cheap about this phone except for the price . The Good : Besides winning on price , this phone was a breeze to set up . The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue . The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly . The Pixel 4a also transferred all data , apps , and pictures from my old Galaxy S7 . It used a USB cable to connect and download everything . Even texts , voicemails , and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost . Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over . Apps needed to be logged into again and there were some forgotten password issues , but nothing that couldn ' t be fixed . Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate . It is a bit different than th 3a and other Android phone as there is no back button and everything is controlled through swipes . It takes some getting used to but works smoothly once you get it down . The camera is outstanding and surpasses any phone previously used . Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features . This battery lasts all day long even with regular use . The battery on the 3a is great and the battery on the 4a is awesome ! It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge takes approximately one hour . The Bad : The bad really isn ’ t all that bad when taken in proper context . There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since it ’ s missing some luxury features . Apparently this phone isn ’ t waterproof , which comes as a surprise to me since I ’ ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water . Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing . It really isn ' t a big deal though since the battery lasts so long this phone is rarely on the charger anyway . This phone does take a USC - C cable so it isn ' t compatible with the cables from older Android and Kindle devices , which use Micro USB cables . It comes with one USB - C cable but you may want to purchase another if you like extra ones around the house or in the car . Again , not a huge deal because of the battery life . Summary : This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users . It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is , making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones . It wins in value , setup , camera , operating speed and battery life . Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have , but those don ’ t weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 4a so I am giving this a strong four stars .\n",

Many new flagship phones have been phasing it out since 2016 , but I did not expect it to be featured on a brand - new phone from a big company like Google . I believe my purchase is a great value , and it ' s rare to get that feeling whenever I buy something new . I ' m confident this phone will last me another few years ( Google even has promised 3 years of firmware updates ) .

Then it would both ring and vibrate on the phone itself . On the Pixel 4a , apparently by design , the only available ringtone options are ring , vibrate or silent . Regardless of the ringtone set , I get some chimes in my hearing aid . I called Google tech support and was told this is working as designed , even though other notifications work as I want . They said it is a difference between media settings and ringtones and ringtones could not do what I wanted and that nobody had reported this issue before .

But , as soon as you look around at the competition globally , this is severely underwhelming . The phone feels outdated already and it ' s new . Add to that that Google doesn ' t give you perks like original quality uploads to Google Photos anymore and they don ' t include facial recognition , it just feels like they aren ' t trying hard enough . The phone is otherwise great , works well , runs smoothly , and doesn ' t have any issues or annoyances . And some of the \u001b[32m<software features:Positive Confidence:0.7872>\u001b[0m are wonderful , like automatically recognizing songs without having to open an app .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 781: I had a Pixel 3 and the \u001b[31m<battery:Negative Confidence:0.9353>\u001b[0m started to drain really quickly . I was a little skeptical about this phone but for the \u001b[32m<price point:Positive Confidence:0.9882>\u001b[0m it ' s really great ! The \u001b[32m<battery life:Positive Confidence:0.9944>\u001b[0m is amazing for this phone and it ' s about the same size as my Pixel 3 . I ' m really pleased with this purchase .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 782: While this isn ' t the highest end phone on the market , it has really great \u001b[32m<features:Positive Confidence:0.9827>\u001b[0m , a very decent \u001b[32m<processor:Positive Confidence:0.9843>\u001b[0m , and unexpectedly long \u001b[32m<battery life:Positive Confidence:0.9922>\u001b[0m for the size . The battery life may be benefiting from the smaller OLED \u001b[31m<screen:Negative Confidence:0.5401>\u001b[0m . The finger print sensor works consistently and is easy to reach . This phone is chalk full of the latest Google features . Granted some of them are gimmicks , but you ' ll be able to impress your friends with a 350USD phone . The \u001b[32m<camera:Positive Confidence:0.958>\u001b[0m is probably the pixel 4as biggest selling point . The funny thing is it isn ' t really the camera itself that makes it good . It ' s all the \u001b[32m<software:Positive Confidence:0.9801>\u001b[0m that allows 1 camera to emulate the functions of a lot of 4 - camera phones . And this emulsion is pretty good . For instance , the portrait mode is able to give that depth is field effect without a depth sensor . I didn ' t even buy this phone for the camera , so I like the fact that I ' m not paying for 6 cameras but I ' m still getting the same functions .\n",

And the \u001b[31m<screen sensitivity:Negative Confidence:0.9989>\u001b[0m is so much that when you ' re scrolling through pages it will randomly select links that you do not want . The fingerprint to unlock the screen has a long delay and takes a few seconds to open . The Pixel 2 I had before is superior to this phone in every way ! I need to return this immediately .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 787: Okay , I ' m switching from a Redmi note 8 pro to the google pixel 4a . I have mixed feelings about this device . I ' ll get to the picture part at the end . This device is small . Iphone 6s is about the same size both in length and width . It feels super cheap . Like a prepaid phone that costs $ 80 dollars at your local walgreens . The interface is not snappy and quick like the YouTube reviewers say it is . It is average . My budget Redmi note 8 pro costs 200 dollars less than this device and it ' s a better experience . I found the fingerprint reader doesn ' t always work , when it works it feels like ages to actually unlock . The same thing with entering a pin . It feels like it takes a long time to actually unlock . Who is this phone for ? Someone who isn ' t really on a phone all the time , it ' s not a powerhouse scrolling Instagram is okay YouTube is okay , the small display is just a let down . I don ' t know what model the youtubers are showing you because this device is small . Like really small . Like this would be fine for a child . Okay the camera . Beautiful pictures in good light , okay pictures in really low light , now comes the bad part about the camera . In areas that have light but it ' s not dark enough for night mode the pictures come out noisy and grainy . Like indoors at 4 pm . For $ 350 I strongly recommend a Xiaomi device . Or step up to the google pixel 5 .\n",

The phone says it cannot communicate with the car system . All my other phones have and still do . Looking on the pixel issues posted , other people are having similar issues . If I can ' t find a fix to connect , I may return as I ' m not trading cars . . The wifi and network connection is fine , no problem s , speed of phone is acceptable .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 798: I ' m coming from a samsung android note 9 . Loved my note 9 but turns out I ' m not that good with big bulky all glass expensive phones . . . Who woulda thought . . . My whole back of my note 9 phone was shattered and the screen was cracked and I had an otterbox on it the entire time I had the thing . Long story short I bought the phone out after 2 years to switch services and when I went to switch they took my case off to switch sim cards and it was a shattered mess which I was highly disappointed about because I thought it was in good shape ! . I could have gotten it fixed for around $ 400 or I could get a different phone . I didn ' t want nothing hella expensive I ' m tired of having to pay extra for phone payments and then just breaking them because obviously I ' m just not good with phones ! I wanted something budget friendly with a good quality camera but still similar to androids system . I ' ve been team android forever now I just really don ' t care for their picture quality though , I have tried iphone out as well I had the iphone x and it just wasn ' t for me , however I did love the picture quality , so since I ' ve tried both ios and android and have certain things I like and disliked for both of them I figured it was time to give pixels a try ! Pros : This phone is cute , little , and light weight phone , but like not so little that the screens no good . The screen to phone ratio is super nice and makes the phone feel smaller with a good sized screen . Which is what I wanted I was over having huge , heavy bulky phones , I have little hands and I constantly was dropping my bigger phones . . . Picture quality is awesome ! It def beats android and I think it might even beat iphones ! Easy set up with transferring from my old phone to this one . The backs plastic ! Which that was what I was looking for ! People complain that \" oh its so boring looking with the plain black plastic back \" . . . I don ' t get it , so youd rather have a pretty glass back that you end up covering with a bulky case . . . Cause that makes so much sense . . . I like how you can either have the navigation buttons or you can use the swipe controls . I like this so your not stuck with one or the other . battery lifes pretty good the charge seems to last me as long as my note 9 did . It def seems very durable . I do have a screen protector along with a case on this phone , not even a good case or screen protector just something cheap I grabbed . I ' ve dropped the phone a few times now and no have had no issues ! Volume is also pretty good Cons : My biggest pet peeves with this phone isssss I hate the way screen shots are on this phone ! Okay so the power button and the volume down button is how you take screen shots , which is normal for screen shots but on this phone the volume buttons and the power button are on the same side which makes it awkward to do and then sometimes when doing it the volume bar will pop up and turn everything all the way down and the bar just stays there which is annoying . . . . I don ' t like how there ' s not as much customization as androids would have , such as changing the themes and stuff which sorta disappoints me . Conclusion : All in all , the pixel 4a really is not a bad budget phone for people like me that are just to rough for these high end all glass , thousand dollar phones . . . I would eventually like to get one of the nicer pixels this one was mostly to try it out and see if I even like them before getting one of the more expensive ones later down the road . Nice thing about pixels even there higher end phones such as the pixel 5 arent robbing you like some of these dang androids and iphones are ! If your looking for a nice budget phone you won ' t go wrong getting this one . Would recommend !\n",

However , the \u001b[31m<manueverability:Negative Confidence:0.9987>\u001b[0m between screens is just cumbersome .

My iPhone 7 Plus was getting a little long in the tooth and I ' d been considering an upgrade but even as an iPhone user since the original one , I ' d become a bit turned off by ever increasing pricing on Apple ' s phones . Also , as a product of the Walkman generation I really missed having a headphone jack . Fast forward four months and I ' m using an iPhone 12 Pro Max . . what went wrong ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing . The Pixel 4a is a really great phone . Nice form factor , always on display , fast and responsive fingerprint reader , a headphone jack and frequent updates to its operating system . My only real misgiving is the lack of wireless charging , which is quickly becoming essential to me . This is a great phone that you can customize to your heart ' s content , and if you ' re not entrenched in Apple ' s ecosystem you can probably go ahead and purchase without any reservations . I say ' probably ' , because I felt very ready to pick up and move away from Apple ' s ecosystem , however your circle of friend , family and co - workers should be taken into account . What do the people in your life use ? If it ' s primarily iPhone , that may provide some friction to your transition over to Android . In my case I found that not being connected to iMessage and Facetime was enough of an inconvenience that I was using my iPod Touch to replace the features I no longer had access to on my phone . Silly , right ? That was my conclusion , and I went ahead and bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max . Do I LIKE one more than the other ? I suppose the iPhone 12 does feel a bit more premium , due largely to the fact that it is . . . I don ' t think it ' s a question of ' like ' , though . Your phone is more a question of fit for your life , and as positively as I felt about the Pixel 4a , the fit wasn ' t quite right . Things may be different for you , but I can stand behind the Pixel 4a as a quality phone and a bargain at its list price .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 840: I was very excited about this phone . I read multiple glowing reviews . Phone arrived yesterday and I ' ve spent several hours with it . I am coming from a 3 - year old Samsung Galaxy S8 . There ' s nothing really wrong with that phone . It ' s just not getting updates anymore and I liked the thought of a pure Android phone . The S8 had some quirks such as a big delay in being able to take a picture while Google Maps was active ( bad for road trips ) . Here are some thoughts / findings about the 4a vs the S8 : 1 . On the 4a I find it a bit frustrating to not being able to close apps as easily as on the S8 2 . The S8 camera has more options - including a pro mode . I think it still takes marginally better pictures than the 4a 3 . The Gboard has a space and down button at the bottom which is impossible to remove . Gboard on S8 does not have this 4 . I find it very easy to hit the back button gesture by mistake on the the 4a and then have to open the app again 5 . I immediately installed a case and screen protector on the 4a , but it still feels like I could easily drop it 6 . The battery life isn ' t that great on the 4a - about the same as the 3 year old S8 I ' d say 7 . Stereo speakers on the 4a is nice - but you have to hold it about a foot away from your face to get the effect 8 . 128 GB of included storage on the 4a is nice ( vs 64 GB on the S8 ) , but I also have a 200 GB SDCard in the S8 9 . 4a gets hot ! It has complained about not being able to do a few things ( transcribe for example ) because it was too hot Jury is still out if it will replace the S8 or not . And if it does replace it , what happens to the old phone ? It ' s only worth $ 100 or less . I ' d say if you were looking for a great phone for the money , and it ' s better that what you currently have , definitely get the 4a as it ' s a good price and has a lot of great features . However , carefully compare it against what you currently have as it might not really be that much better .\n",

Since \u001b[31m<processor:Negative Confidence:0.9693>\u001b[0m is a tad slow , it takes like 2 seconds to process but it doesn ' t bother me . If you haven ' t tried astrophotography it ' ll amaze you . Even my eyes cannot see things clearly but with just a touch of light this phone can take a picture like it ' s under afternoon light . For everyday \u001b[32m<use:Positive Confidence:0.7715>\u001b[0m it ' s sleek and fast enough , i never have a problem . Coming from ip x I ' d say this phone is wonderful !\n",

It ' s nice to have a clean phone . Coming from a OnePlus 5T , I sort of am estranged from a smaller size phone . It ' s big enough but I need to adapting . \u001b[32m<Fingerprint reader:Positive Confidence:0.9872>\u001b[0m works superb , everything is a smooth install experience . The only downside so far is the thickness of the case but it feels classy and good . The phone without the case is a nice feel . Definitely not a fingerprint magnet . And WOW ! My thumb can reach the whole screen again after so many years . An update on camera and software will follow , but there is no bloatware which is very pleasant .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 867: With this phone , the hardware and the software are allowed to integrate into their perfect potential . Google being the creator of both is likely what makes this phone better than its ( overpriced ) competitors . I haven ' t had the phone for quite a month yet , so I ' ll update this review if I need to . Here ' s where a more \" budget \" phone surprisingly stands out : 1 ) The speaker has more clarity versus that of the Note10 + . 2 ) The fingerprint reader on the back has a much higher success rate than the Note10 + ' s ( in regards to accuracy ) . It is also easier to physically use . 3 ) Google kindly allows for the bootloader to be unlocked . So if you are feeling bold , you can load on a custom ROM . ( Who knows ? Maybe that would help you learn to love coding ; it did for me . ) 4 ) Insane battery life . I charge it every other night . And this isn ' t with light use ; I ' d say the same might be true for you . 5 ) The ergonomics of the phone make it easy on the hand to hold . It rarely falls out of my hand , unlike the Note10 + . It really should get a star off for not being water - resistant , and another half - star off for not supporting wireless charging . But it ' s just such a well - performing machine that I refuse to subtract anything from my rating . TL ; DR - This is the closest Android you can get to what makes an iPhone so special , which is the hardware and software being tightly integrated from the factory .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 868: This \u001b[32m<phone:Positive Confidence:0.9954>\u001b[0m is literally the best phone I have ever had . Exceedingly amazing in every way . The \u001b[32m<camera:Positive Confidence:0.9995>\u001b[0m is superb\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 869: I ' m glad to have a pure Android experience again with no carrier bloatware and no stupid system modifications from manufacturers like OnePlus . ( They are the worst manufacturer in terms of needlessly killing background apps ) . The camera is fantastic ! It ' s half because of the software and half because of the large pixels in the sensor . It ' s great in low light . The Night Sight mode is so much fun ! On a tripod or some other stable surface , astrophotography mode will engage in Night Sight mode that allows for amazing star photos . The real - time HDR adjustment and preview is really nice . Basically , you tap on some portion of the photo to choose what you want the primary exposure to lock onto ( like the bright part of a sunset ) then a slider appears that lets you control the fill light . It ' s wonderful ! It got the Android 11 update immediately after I bought it , so that ' s cool . Lots of nice little updates in that . The default gesture navigation doesn ' t work well with 3rd party launchers . ( I use Nova Launcher ) . When I swipe up to go to the home screen , I can ' t tap any icons for 1 second . They don ' t respond . It ' s weird . But with the old school 3 - button nav it works fine . Swiping up from the bottom also appears to choose the 3rd party launcher and if it were an app , then it reopens it . That might be part of that problem . Neither of these things happen with the default launcher , but that launcher wastes so much space on the clock and the search bar , so I don ' t like it . The CPU / GPU is plenty fast for me . I don ' t play much mobile gaming . Just some board games sometimes . The AI in Waterdeep takes it ' s turns quite a bit faster than on my old OnePlus 3T , so that ' s nice . Headphone jack and fingerprint reader are a huge plus for me . You get a lot of phone for the price !\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 871: Just received this phone . It is smaller than it is described , and it is not compatible with most universal charging cables . It does not come with a \u001b[31m<SIM:Negative Confidence:0.9982>\u001b[0m CARD to Activate this phone it will port your information from your current phone to this one but it wont activate unless you purchase one online or at the Sprint / T - mobile Store . We made and appointment and it did not take long to activate . The phone is fast and has tutorials to learn to navigate the phone . It will take a little time to get use to as it is not like the S 6789 10 series . The other negative is it doesnt fit with any covers so have ordered 3 different types and hoping the 3rd one fits . Jury still out on this cell !\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 872: Overall , this phone is very unintuitive . There ' s no back button so it uses the \u001b[31m<screen:Negative Confidence:0.9967>\u001b[0m edges , you ' ll constantly find yourself going Back when you ' re just scrolling around . You have to swipe up from the bottom to check your apps , you also have to swipe up to check \u001b[31m<recent apps:Negative Confidence:0.9834>\u001b[0m , besides these 2 instances fighting each other , the phone likes to ignore your swipe as well The phone is also very slippery but cases are hard to find .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 873: Pros : Well balanced hardware , its snappy and responsive . 6GB of ram have been paired with a processor that can use them . Has a good camera , though I really should snap more pictures and videos with it . front facing camera is great for video calls . Of all of the phones that I have used this is the best in that category . Cons : the UI has a learning curve to it . so take the tutorial . Though this is a new feature with the current Android OS , there is no back button . Yeah I know . I miss it too . there is no slot for a micro SD card . Not a problem if you use the cloud to back them up , but I don ' t always go were I have a data connection , plus I like to move my videos between devices . And the front facing camera feels off . I personally like the centered punch out cameras on the LG and Samsung phones that I have used . Overall . this is a good value . Even with the arrival of 5G network on the horizon . I recommend this as it fits in the palm of my hand . Has a well matched processor and ram configuration and has 128GB of storage . which should be enough for most users . the front facing camera works really well on video calls even in low light . And the WiFi radio has a good to great range , depending on frequency used .\n",

The \u001b[32m<prices:Positive Confidence:0.8401>\u001b[0m was good although the built in obsolescence of phones needs to be looked at .

If would of knew that , then I would off not bought this phone . The reason I bought this phone because it was small and compact . But I had to buy another phone that would ring so I could answer my calls for business . I would not recommend this phone to anybody because this seems to be a major issue for this phone .

My only complaint is the voice to text function for texting is not very good . I had a low priced LG that worked far better in this area .

It ’ s still a decent size but it actually fits in my jeans pocket . The screen size makes up for it because it takes up literally the entire front of the phone . Overall : I know this review lacks a lot of key features for this phone and it definitely doesn ’ t do it justice . But overall this phone is amazing and I would buy it again . This is my first Google phone and I ’ m impressed ! Go for it ! !\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 907: Coming from a flagship iPhone 11 Pro , my standards were high . I switched to Android because Google Fi WiFi calling was not available on iPhone . My initial impression was that the phone felt cheap because of the plastic body , but it is justified because of the price tag . + The \u001b[32m<build quality:Positive Confidence:0.9603>\u001b[0m is great + Screen resolution is not as good as the iPhone , but good enough if you ' re just going to be watching YouTube videos and using social media . - I believe the \u001b[31m<battery:Negative Confidence:0.9771>\u001b[0m size is larger than the iPhone 11 Pro , but I feel like I have to charge more throughout the day .

It takes longer to \u001b[31m<auto:Negative Confidence:0.9979>\u001b[0m rotate . Sometimes it just doesn ' t rotate at all . Overall , I can ' t complain about the phone with such a low price tag .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 922: I finally switched from Samsung and Motorola phones to a Pixel . I had read a lot of websites extolling how good of a \u001b[32m<price:Positive Confidence:0.8559>\u001b[0m it was based on the features and decided to give it a chance . Overall , I would say that it is worth the money , but , having it for a few days now , there are some obvious pros and cons . Pros : Definitely the price 3 years of \u001b[32m<software:Positive Confidence:0.6956>\u001b[0m support / upgrades Not full of bloatware Cons : The \u001b[32m<camera:Positive Confidence:0.6669>\u001b[0m takes great pictures , but the software is lacking so every time that you take a picture and want to see it , you need to wait 5 seconds before the phone processes it . There is no wireless charging . There is no facial recognition . The \u001b[31m<sound:Negative Confidence:0.9948>\u001b[0m was a real letdown . It is not nearly as loud and clear as similarly price phones . The \u001b[31m<screen:Negative Confidence:0.9949>\u001b[0m is a bit small and the actual body of the phon doesn ' t seem as solid as I have come to expect from similar phones . I definitely think it ' s in the above average range based on the amount that you are paying . But , keep these cons in mind and add in that soon Google will be releasing the 5g versions which this one is not .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 925: I have had my previous phone for a long time and it ' s just begun to go wonky . I know old phones create a problem at disposal for our planet , so I have been holding onto the old one for many years . In fact , it was my first mobile phone . So switching to a new phone for me is similar to buying a 2015 car with computer and electronics vs my 20 year old car with none . I expect I will be using this for some time without having a clue how to use all its features . So I will just address the basics . The power button is in a horrible place and I am forever hitting it . So that sucks . It is thankfully silver , so at least it is easy to see . And the phone is motion activated , so having the screen light up on pick up is a feature I can get used to fast ! Screen resolution is a huge improvement as are many basics . Just had my first spam call and was delighted to have the option to reply with Google ' s spam filter and messaging that asks the caller to leave their id and message . I saw it in real time as text to confirm it was a caller looking to sell something . The ring tones are nice too , the message function kinda clunky , system settings were difficult to find , so much so I eventually created a desktop shortcut to access them . The recorded audio quality sounds muffled ( when I set up my vm message ) and the camera , which I though would be exceptional , oddly interprets some colors . I use it to post pics of my paintings to Instagram , and it couldn ' t tell the difference between teal and blue . Battery life is good . To transfer data between the new phone and the old was a pain because only after contacting tech support did I find out the enclosed usb cable ONLY works between Pixel phones ! They really should include info like that with the cable / instructions and alert you when you buy . I had to buy a new cable for this one time use and wait until I had it in hand before I could transfer my contact list , etc . This phone cost me more than my Dell desktop computer and large screen . I think it ' s highway robbery what this and other even more expensive phones cost , but it is what it is . The position of the on switch exactly where you hold it , really is lousy design that I have to deal with every time I pick it up .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 926: I bought the Pixel 4a after using a Pixel 2XL for two years . There are a lot of wonderful features within the 4a , but I am just not as impressed with it as I was hoping . For the \u001b[32m<price:Positive Confidence:0.9609>\u001b[0m , it is a stellar phone . It ' s fast , it ' s pretty , it doesn ' t look as cheap as it is , and I honestly can ' t say anything back about it - besides 2 things . Even after using my 2XL for two years , the \u001b[31m<battery life:Negative Confidence:0.9704>\u001b[0m is still better than the 4a . I find myself charging the 4a several times a day , whereas I rarely had to charge my 2XL once thought the day . Also , the \u001b[31m<camera:Negative Confidence:0.9835>\u001b[0m . It is SO fuzzy with the front camera , and the \u001b[31m<rear camera:Negative Confidence:0.978>\u001b[0m honestly didn ' t blow me away . I ' m a professional photographer , so I ' m a bit snobby about the camera on my phone . Honestly the battery life for the 4a is just okay . If you want a cheap , high quality phone that packs a punch and a half , get this one . I personally am returning mine and buying the 4XL in hopes I ' m more satisfied !\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 927: Highly recommended .

One downside is that it doesn ' t have an SD card slot , but I ' m finding the 128gb \u001b[32m<builtin storage:Positive Confidence:0.9898>\u001b[0m is more than enough for now . I bought this as a replacement for a Motorola Moto Z2 Play phone after the front glass started to separate from the frame . The Motorola was a little bigger than the Pixel 4a ( and a little unwieldy if the truth be told ) but to my mind the smaller \u001b[32m<size:Positive Confidence:0.9403>\u001b[0m of the Pixel 4a makes it easy to handle , certainly one - handed . Though smaller in overall size the whole - screen display of the Pixel 4a seems to be about the same size as that of the Motorola and I find it \u001b[32m<runs:Positive Confidence:0.9853>\u001b[0m a bit faster than the Motorola too .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 933: This phone for one thing has an awesome camera which I use for everything . I was getting so used to not getting clear sharp or correctly exposed photos with the Moto I had before . I struggled to get a clear closeup or sometimes even distant photos with the Moto . With this phone I am amazed , I get nicely exposed and clear pictures in all light levels . I use my phone to document items and even documents using the photo scan app and it works perfectly . I couldn ’ t have done that with Moto it just wouldn ’ t happen the camera and app on Motorola is horrible and I got no help from Motorola at all it ’ s a defect numerous people have . With this camera I have none of that the pics are just crystal clear and I don ’ t have to stand on my head and pray just for a good pic . Thanks Google . I like google everything it just works ! Thank you ! I can get perfect pictures for my reviews on Google maps and Amazon etc . I couldn ’ t do that before ! The camera is important to me because I don ’ t carry my big digital camera anymore it ’ s just to much hassle . I want a nice clear picture taking camera that ’ s easy to use and quick ! I use the camera more than phone calls and text so I really love this phone ! I find that the camera functions can do very extensive things and for once they are easy to use which I didn ’ t have before . Google please keep it up make a camera that is good and easy to use and just works ! I haven ’ t commented on the actual phone functions as I just live for the camera ! I use it to document my old pictures and convert them to digital and store them on Google Photos , love it . I ’ ve done the old way trying to store on a desktop computer on hard drives , discs and flash drives and a scanner . Not anymore I had to re digitize my old paper pictures to google and I can access them effortlessly using Google Photos . I ’ m sold , I use Google for everything now . I ’ m 65 and this digital apps , camera phone and Google pics is just so much easier to do . The camera itself works excellent and menus are so much better and easier to use . I will probably be back to revisit this review as I discover more things about the Pixel 4a . Thanks again for a good phone at a reasonable cost .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 934: An important smartphone release at a time when there seems to be a real shift away from flagship devices and a move toward mid range value propositions . And with the global economic challanges ahead , the release of the Pixel 4a could be a watershed moment . The form factor is ideal for me . Whilst I understand the benefits of larger screens , the tradeoffs are too big IMO . The 4a is just so easy to handle and carry and it is so light ! The pure Android is a plus . I have had bloatware on my previous two devices ( Huawei ) so it is a welcome change . The option to ' pause ' apps is great too . Battery is good . Easily a full day . I now have battery saver mode set to auto - enable at 75 % and can get 1 . 5 days of moderate usage . I have not had a chance to use the camera much at all but can say that the colours are an improvement over my Huawei P30 and so is the video stabilization . The P30 has an excellent camera with some advantages over the 4a but I like the results from the 4a more . As an aside , the P30 was a form favourite of mine , the best smartphone I had owned . Ticked a lot of boxes including its compact for factor . It edges the 4a on performance ( the 4a does suffer from occasional lags and stutters ) and has a few extra features like face unlock and onscreen fingerprint reader . But the 4a has nudged in front of the P30 , albeit only slightly . Anyway , I am sold on the 4a . It delivers in spades . I don ' t need wireless charging nor do I drop my phones in water . I don ' t need a 90 + hz display ( the 4a ' s OLED display is excellent BTW ) nor do I need facial recognition . I like having the option of a headphone jack though and I like having extra money to spend on other things in life . I have purchased the Spigen Rugged Armour case which provides excellent protection .\n",

I haven ' t moved , and have been with my carrier for many , many years , and this phone is the only phone that can ' t find the signal . Constantly . As in most of the time . Usage is not intuitive . It does many other very annoying things , and I can ’ t figure out how to make it stop doing the very annoying things . I went online for a user manual and the link sent me to a site to set up your new Pixel . Um , already done – where ’ s the user manual ? There is no user manual – too bad , so sad . Also , a search of google , ironically , reaps no results on how to make the very annoying things stop . It is possible this phone is customizable , but you have to be a google master phone engineer to figure it out , and they ’ re sure as stuff not going to tell you . Bottom line for me was money . Calls generally work ok , as does text . But email ? Holy C , you ' d think I was asking it to do something easy ! I have to slog through a full crap - load of automatic and unwanted questions ( can ’ t answer the call without a question about contacts , can ’ t read a text without question about contacts , etc . ) before I can do the common things . I do wonder if google even knows you can do that later IF you want to at all ? So annoying ! I also wish it had a home button as I ' m forever accidentally calling people when swiping up which , as far as I have learned to date , appears to be the only way to get to the home screen and jumps right through contacts . Also have to go to home screen if I send an email because it kicks me out . If I want to read and respond to the next email , gotta start anew from the home screen . Stupid . Would not buy this phone again , although I think google could easily fix the operating system . I wonder if they ever will , though . Doubt it . Very disappointing .\n",

My biggest concern was the screen size difference , but with the slim bezels on the 4a , the overall screen size is really not much different when compared to the 3a XL . You can see a slight difference when you hold them side to side , but in practical terms of use , its very neglible . As for the phone itself . . . I love it ! It has the awesome camera I have come to love with the Pixel lineup , the fingerprint reader is still in place , it has more memory and RAM than the prior model and the size is much more manageable than the 3a XL was . While I do have very large hands , the smaller physical size of the phone is just much easier to handle , and much easier to operate one handed . Prior to my Pixel 3a XL , I had the Huawei Mate 10 Pro - which I absolutely loved . I have also had Nexus and Galaxy phones , as well as a few other more budget friendly phones . For the MONEY - this phone is an absolute slam dunk ! Everything you need , nothing you don ' t . Full Transparency - I am not a gamer , so I can not attest to how it holds up in heavy gaming . But beyond that , it works wonderfully . If there is any downside , it is the battery . Not that it ' s small . . . I have gotten through all day on more than one occasion . However , with my slightly more than average use , I do find myself needing to top off late in the evening . The good news is that in as little as 15 mins , this thing will charge up 50 % or more , so it ' s not a huge deal . If you are going to go out for the evening , just plug it up while you are getting ready , and you ' ll be more than good to go ! They claim that the adaptive battery software will continue to optimize the phone ' s battery life over time , so we ' ll see how that goes . But despite that , it is still a phone I would recommend ALL DAY LONG , especially when comparing to other phones in this price point . Oh , and having just one color choice ? ? What does that really matter , especially when virtually all of us put some sort of case on the phone . There ' s a good variety of cases to add color , so don ' t let that stop you .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 983: I went from a Galaxy S7 to this Pixel 4A 5 days ago . So far I like it . It is very similar to the S7 in overall size , but without the bezels the screen is bigger . Most functions seem similar , I ' m not sure what the raves about a \" pure Android experience \" are about . I don ' t trust and don ' t use either the facial recognition or fingerprint reader , so I just gave them a middle star rating . The speakers are loud enough for me and I have a some age related hearing deficit . I ' ve always used an ATT store to set up my phones before , but they told me they no longer do that for unlocked phones , despite paying upfront for their network for the past 8 years . I followed Google ' s online instructions for transferring the data from my S7 and they worked fine . The only irritating thing was that the directions said the box contained an adapter for attaching a USB C cable to a USB micro ; it doesn ' t . It is an adapter for connecting a full size USB to the USB C in the box . So I had to go get a full size USB to USB Micro cable . Overall , I can ' t see a lot of difference between this phone and my previous S7 , except that I now get security updates for Android and the S7 no longer does . Why pay $ 700 + for a \" flagship phone \" when this does the job for half the price or much less ? And 5G ? Give me a break . Lots of hype and no benefits so far . I don ' t expect to see a benefit in my rural area for many years and it still doesn ' t work any better than 4G LTE in downtown Denver where my wife ' s office is . So , a middle of the line phone works very well and this was the best I could find for my purposes .\n",

It \u001b[32m<came:Positive Confidence:0.9992>\u001b[0m quickly and I was able to transfer data in a reasonable amount of time .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 990: This was quite a step up for me going from a HTC Desire 526 smart phone to the Google Pixel 4a smartphone . I like the fact that it is unlocked . Never buy a phone that is not . In that way you can take it to the carrier of your choice . I ' ve been with Verizon for 4 years now . And they keep giving me perks for my loyalty so you never bite the hand that feeds you . Now about the phone itself . I like the fact it had a transfer device with it so transferring my files , pics , and contacts was very easy for me and granted I am not real techie but I can do a few things without help . I like the fact it has 128gb of internal memory so no need for an internal micro sd card . Great camera too . I like you can set it to block out telemarketers . It takes very little time to charge it and the charge lasts a very long time . 12 hours approximately depending on what you do with your phone . I am NOT a gamer as I view it as a big waste of time . The phone has limitless potentials . I like the OLED screen too . It ' s very light and thin which is nice . I do suggest you get a good rubber armor for it which I did . People I talk to ask me what kind of phone I am on now because I sound really good on it . You won ' t experience drop calls on this phone no matter where you are . I ' m 68 years young and hope this will be the last phone I will ever own until the day they put me in a box . It has a great assortment of ringer sounds to choose from or if you don ' t want to be disturbed you can set it to that too . Great Wi - Fi too and you can turn it into your own private Wi - Fi hotspot if you choose to do so . Which I think is very cool . I don ' t think you can go wrong with this phone as like I said before the potentials of what it can do seem to be limitless . Also the learning curve is quite easy and it ' s an Android . Iphones are just a name and you pay dearly for it . I ' ll stick to Android phones . In conclusion , I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a very functional and efficient / proficient phone . Buy it . You won ' t regret it .\n",

Sólo le falta versatilidad , en calidad visual y detalle de lo MEJOR que hay en el mercado . En video es bueno , pero se podría haber mejorado un poco más ( apple sigue siendo superior en esto ) . - Tamaño 10 / 10 . Muy ergonómico para el día a día , fácilmente se puede ocupar con una sola mano , liviano . - Software 8 . 5 / 10 . Android de Google va muy fluido en este dispositivo , a pesar de que el chip 730G es inferior a otros ( 765G ) . Puntos positivos , los 3 años de actualizaciones , Google assistant y que no tiene app ' s basura como MIUI y Samsung . Sin embargo android 11 hay que mejorarlo un poco más , lo cuál es entendible ya que se ha actualizado recientemente . - Batería 7 / 10 . Para mi uno de los puntos más \" flojos \" . Google hizo una buena optimización con el consumo de la batería y se debe destacar , fácilmente se puede llegar a un día de uso ( en cuarentena he ocupado bastante el consumo multimedia , YT , instagram ) . Sin embargo , no sé cómo se comportará en un año más , razón por la cuál hubiera agradecido tener una batería de al menos 3400 mA o más . - Diseño y Construcción 7 / 10 . Destacar que el teléfono en mano se ve mucho mejor que en fotos , o entrega una sensación un poco más premium de lo que realmente esperaba . El acabado en plástico me da cierta sensación de fragilidad si el teléfono se llegara a caer y temo por la pantalla ( espero estar equivocado ) . Por último , visualmente se debe mejorar , sigue siendo un teléfono poco atractivo para la mayoría de usuarios . Creo que si Google mejorara sus diseños , podrían atraer a muchos más consumidores . - Precio 10 / 10 . A pesar del costo de envío e importación , sigue siendo mejor alternativa que los modelos que se venden en mi país ( Huawei , Samsung , Xiaomi , Motorola , etc . ) por el mismo precio .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1039: [ May 7 , 2021 thoughts on Pixel 4a , ordered November 8 , 2020 and used daily ever since ] PROS : Form factor and weight - This is the best marriage I have found . Fantastic screen real estate , sensible ( ideal ? ) resolution , and just terrific dimensions for me . This thing is light weight for its size , and I love that more than I can possibly express . Hand fatigue has been all but completely eliminated . Give me plastics , baby ! I have no desire for metals that don ' t add to functionality ( and apparently , from something I saw on YouTube , this phone is insanely rugged , even with a plastic shell ) . Glass is always heavier and less durable than other materials choices , and it ' s just altogether not well suited for the backside of a mobile handset , IMO . I think Apple charges $ 550 to replace the back glass on most modern iPhones . This Pixel 4a is the total package and stickers for $ 200 less than the price of Apple ' s back glass repair . Price : Performance - While I can ' t compare this phone to another of its kind with a higher performing Qualcomm , I am never wanting for speed . This phone has been wonderfully fluid and performant for my day - to - day needs . The lean Android experience on the Pixel line really lets its mid - range Qualcomm shine . I most recently carried both an iPhone 7 Plus and 2020 SE , and both proved plenty fast for anything I do ; this 4a is no exception . Background app refreshes seem to be on par with what I had using 3GB iPhones . No real surprises . My day - to - day habits seem mostly unaffected by any background app refreshes I ' ve noticed . I think the 6GB of memory strikes a good balance for the 4a . I don ' t game . Well , I play some chess now and again , including occasional analysis using very demanding engines ( Stockfish , etc ) , but in general I can ' t comment on gaming performance . Battery - Battery life and charging time have been lovely . I seldom charge to 100 - percent , instead I prefer to just give little 5 - to 15 - minute charges periodically during the day , while keeping the battery in the 30 - to 70 - percent range where possible . This thing charges way , way faster than my older 7 Plus and 2020 SE iPhones and overall battery life is likely comparable or better from what I can gather ( very unscientifically ) . I leave it to the readers to determine how important battery life is and do some research of their own . Camera - It ' s so good it doesn ' t even make sense . Shooting stills , the 4a smashes my old iPhone 7 Plus my a wide margin and the 2020 SE couldn ' t hold a candle either . I think that ' s being objective . I ' ve had quite a bit of low - level , professional photography training at University level and time behind the lens of DSLRs , and I ' m quite astonishing that I can get such quality images from the 4a . The software image processing is pure magic . I have kids , and they ' re the important subjects for me . I ' d guessed the 4a might struggle with motion , particularly in lower light , which would have been a deal - breaker for me , but this thing takes \" keepers \" practically every single time . Glorious . Most already know how well Pixel phones shoot non - moving subjects , so I won ' t carry on about that . It ' s an exciting camera experience . Concerning video , the 1080p 30 - and 60 - frame shooting has not disappointed either , and the image stabilization is truly excellent . I don ' t mess with 4k on phones ( yet ) , so no comment there . I don ' t take selfies , so I won ' t comment on the front - facing camera either . Android - The gesture navigation is fantastic , particularly the ability to go back by swiping in from either the left - or right - hand side of the display . Massively convenient and easy on the hands . Updates / security patches are crucial for me , and with a Pixel , scorching fast updates are what you get , and support duration bests most Android - based OEMs . Fingerprint recognition - Works as well and as fast as any I ' ve experienced . Thought the rear placement would bug me . It absolutely does not . Rear placement is probably my preference now . Well executed . I like . CONS : Audio volume / intensity - The 4a just doesn ' t get as loud as some other modern handsets . It ' s tricky to listen to a podcast or whatever when I ' m doing dishes , for example . That said , the audio quality is perfectly satisfactory , to me . Google Search - There ' s a Google search bar installed by default on the home screen . I leave mine there and find it useful . When tapped , you ' re presented with the ability to \" search apps , web , and more . . . \" ( much like the search on iOS when you pull down from the top ) . Google / Android learns over time , so that eventually it can quickly present you with what you ' re most likely to want . Works great , more often than not . But the problem for me is that it ' s inconsistent with regards to displaying apps . It must be that about 20 - percent of the time it doesn ' t display apps , so I ' m forced to swipe up from the bottom of the display to close the interface , then tap the Google search bar again before it populates apps in the query . I can ' t figure out what causes this for the life of me , and I ' ve owned an IT MSP for years , so this ain ' t my first rodeo with tech devices ! Frustrating , but muscle memory makes this only a half - second affair to correct . Dependability - I ' ve long used the same MVNO for cell service , which I mention only because there exists a small possibility that it ' s of importance here : I ' ve found a few occasions where I can ' t place phone calls . To fix , for some reason , a reboot was required . I haven ' t had any issues in the past few months , but it ' s probably because I ' ve changed habits ; now , whenever there ' s an update to something low - level from Android ( not just a basic app update ) , I reboot the phone . An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure ? ? Anyway , I ' d have a \" need \" to reboot an iPhone maybe once every six months , outside of forced reboots from doing an iOS update . To have had to monthly ( or maybe even more frequently ) reboot this 4a in order to connect phone calls ( with no warning as to any trouble , unless I attempted to place a call and \" connect the dots \" ) is unfortunate . I don ' t like to have to think about mitigating critically buggy behavior by rebooting my phone from time to time . OLED - I ' m sensitive to flicker , so I basically hate OLED . My daily driver laptop is a ThinkPad T480s LARGELY because its 1080p IPS is flicker - free ( no PWM ) . This 4a gives me viewing fatigue after a relatively short while . On the 4a , unless you ' re at max brightness ( exactly 100 - percent ) , you can expect flicker in the ~ 122 to 255Hz range . That ' s too low for me . I would prefer an LCD , like the ones I had in my iPhone 7 Plus or 2020 SE . I could view those endlessly without fatigue - read books on them , you name it . But the industry does trend , and trend it does for the contrast ratio specs and inky blacks the kids rave about these days { rolls eyes } . Overall : This is probably the finest overall set of compromises I ' ve ever found in a cell phone , and I ' ve owned many of them since 1994 . I ' m highly satisfied with this handset , and I think very little could realistically be done today to improve upon the formula that is the Pixel 4a . Google has made a proper phone for adults . 9 / 10 DO recommend !\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1066: The phone itself is absolutely amazing , performance is great , even though some reviewers are saying that it is falling behind some other competitors , I haven ' t really noticed any hiccups or lags while using the phone and apps almost always stay open in the background unless I open like 20 of them . I don ' t really play games on my phone but I think it will handle most games with ease unless u want to play on max settings . Screen is really really good , I came from a samsung so I know what a good amoled screen feels like and this one is great , even at this resolution the image and the color accuracy is really sharp , could have been a little brighter though , but haven ' t really bothered me its good enough even in the sunlight . Camera is absolutely amazing , especially at this price point , its flagship class . Night mode is absolutely amazing . Takes amazing pictures , sharp and color accurate . Video recording is great as well . The only downside can be considered the fact that sometimes when you take a pictures it takes like 2 - 3 second to process it , but other than that it is really really good , like one of the best . Many people say that the holepunch camera cutout is annoying , but it is in a such a spot that it disappears in use , even during watching videos and movies . I almost never notice it while watching content or browsing , unless I absolutely have to see an info that is written on that corner . Battery , the probably the only downside of this phone , you might be like why ? well because it is inconsistent , it can last you with the same exact use on most days for like 6 and even 7 hours ! but on others it might last 3 or 4 , I don ' t understand why is the battery like this , from what I have researched in background it runs some kind of android system process that bottlenecks it from time to time . But overall I would rate it 4 stars , would have been 5 if it was not like this . Fingerprint scanned is , well really really fast , almost instant , but like other fingerprint scanners , if your fingers are wet it wont recognize them , but its like this on like 90 % of others phones which I have used with this feature so It doesn ' t really bother me . Build quality is good , I don ' t mind the plastic back because it feels really good in your hand , its smooth and not slippery , it is really nice to hold it in hand , but as most other users I have a case on it . Other google features really make this phone a good experience , for example the music recognition and others . Overall this phone is a solid 4 . 7 out of 5 , as I said the battery can be a mix bag but other than that it is great . I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants a good phone , which has some good features , amazing camera , good battery life on most days , nice screen , good performance and solid , nice feel in the hand .

Navigation \u001b[31m<gestures:Negative Confidence:0.9989>\u001b[0m are unresponsive or erratic . Gesture style keyboards are nearly impossible to use . It really gets bad when the phone gets hot , which doesn ' t take long at all when you ' re using it . I ' ve been pulling my hair out dealing with the issue . Hope a fix is coming .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1069: I had the Pixel 4a for a month in late 2020 , and I generally liked the phone . The most important part that makes this phone great is the price , $ 350 . It ' s not going to get you any top - tier iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra , but it gives you everything the general user would possibly need - a decently fast Snapdragon 730G SOC , 6GB RAM , and 128GB storage . That ' s something that not even the $ 830 base configuration of iPhone 12 gets you . Of course , being $ 350 there are a few things that it misses out on compared to higher - tier phones . One of those things would be the plastic unibody build over something like a metal and glass sandwich . On a phone of this price point it ' s fine , though I did have a bit of plastic creaking near the SIM slot . It was just an annoyance at worst , because the rest of the plastic build felt fine . Wireless charging is also not present , this may disappoint some that used it but it didn ' t bother me cause I never used wireless charging on my iPhone 8 . There ' s no water resistance either , which did raise my eyebrows a bit before I bought the phone but I don ' t submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty places . One thing this does have that the $ 700 Pixel 5 doesn ' t have is a headphone jack . So if you still use anything with a 3 . 5mm plug , this phone has you covered with no need for adapters ! The speakers are also quite good , with one speaker on the bottom next to the USB - C port and one built into the earpiece . As for the software , it ' s got three years of updates which is better than many Android manufactures , but it still won ' t top Apple ' s software support . I did notice a few software bugs when I used it , mainly with YouTube Vanced ' s PIP mode after a certain amount of time . Restarting fixed the issue but it was an annoyance . Hopefully that was just Android 11 and that gets fixed with a future update . Battery life is also pretty decent , better than the aging battery on my iPhone 8 since I could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night . Given that it ' s a small phone by today ' s standards it ' s not going to be a battery life king , but it ' s better than the $ 400 iPhone SE . The size is something I loved about this phone , my hands are relatively small and I like my phone to be pocketable , which is something that I ' m not a fan of with most new phones being over 6 inches in size . The 5 . 81 - inch edge - to - edge screen Is of a similar size to my iPhone 8 and the iPhone X , thus I could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pockets . This is something I ' m sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phones . The camera has been the definition of the Pixel phones since the first ones launched in 2016 . This phone has an amazing single 12MP lens , mostly made great by Google ' s computational photography software . Night mode was very nice to use , as in the scenarios I used it in it helped out take better photos at night . I ' m no expert with cameras so I don ' t know much about white balance , dynamic range , etc . I do like how this phone gives you one great camera as opposed to other manufacturers which give you like seven different pretty - much - useless camera sensors . Overall , this is the phone to buy if you ' re on a budget of less than $ 500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general needs . I would suggest going for the Pixel 4a 5G version if you can afford a $ 500 phone as that has a second ultrawide camera lens , a faster Snapdragon 765G SOC , and as the name says , 5G connectivity . That phone will overall will give you a very very close experience to the Pixel 5 , but if you don ' t have that much to put down for a phone , and if you like the standard 4a ' s smaller size , this phone is the way to go . I highly recommend it and I would personally pick this any day of the week over a similarly priced phone from a China brand like Oppo , Xiaomi , ZTE , Vivo , etc .\n",

I ' ve had the phone for about a week and a half and so far am liking it a lot . Pros : Nice weight , good responsiveness Cons : Misinterprets light touches , turns off while looking at it . The cons might be something I just need to hunt down settings for . It seems to be over sensitive when I try to swipe . It ' s often drilling down to the next screen when I don ' t want it to .

Maybe if you shoot a lot of video this phone wouldn ' t hold out long , but for my very average usage it ' s fine . Does it have a fancy glass or metal case ? No , but most people with fancy looking phones put a case on them anyway . Or they crack . Does it have a punch hole camera ? Yes , and here ' s my only major gripe . I never use the selfie camera , and Netflix seems to be the only major streaming app that can stretch to full screen . All of the other apps I have ( Hulu , HBO Max , Prime Video ) slam the video to the right hand side which will round off the corners of 16 : 9 video .

I chose the 4a in part because it ' s a smaller unit . I don ' t want a cigar box in my pocket . The compromise was on how narrow it is - - a bit too narrow , less screen , not as substantial in the hand . But those are tradeoffs . Nice to have a clean Android install and updates ! PROS Comfortable size Good display Responsive and smooth action Battery life is excellent - I get 2 - 3 days but watch little video , play no games , keep location off unless I need it Camera has pretty good night mode I don ' t use a \" wrapper \" on my phone - it slides in / out of pocket easier \" bare \" . Dropped it once , no damage . Fingers crossed . ( I don ' t use face recog or fingerprint reader ) GREAT price ! CONS A bit too narrow Display is not as good as the reviews would have you believe Ditto on the camera - - I ' m not very happy with it . The controls are clumsy , including the exposure hotspot . I really miss the Turbo 2 ' s \" wave your hand \" to see notifications . Seems to me this would be easy to implement on all phones . Screen is slow to populate when booting It ' s probably Android or the app , not the phone , but it often plays the wrong ringtones on the alarm The only other phone I considered seriously ( I looked at a lot , \" in person \" ! ) is the Samsung S21 ( not 5G ) at a higher price . If I were to do it again I might be swayed to get that instead . The camera is just better as is the screen . But I ' ll be honest - - $ 349 for an unlocked 4a is hard to beat ! Unless your phone is a really big deal to you , the 4a does the job nicely . One last thing : I ' ll never buy another locked phone again !\n",

Pros : - Beautiful , bright , OLED screen that screams of a value point much much higher that where it currently sits . - Powerful camera features , especially Night Sight from its big brothers , that works fantastically in all sorts of difficult lighting conditions . - Good battery life , easily serviceable for a full day because of the efficient processor . - Great feeling and looking build ( not sure what all the hype is about glass backs when plastic feels this good ) - Wonderful haptic feedback and full - sounding loudspeaker - Headphone jack is back ! - Rear fingerprint sensor that serves as notification pull - down - Wonderful size and form factor . I have large hands and still feel like this footprint is perfect - Very capable and efficient 730G chipset ( less than 20 % slower than the 765G on Pixel 5 ) Cons - No wide angle or telephoto lens ( personally would have loved to see a 3x 12MP lens perhaps ? ) - No wireless charging or water resistance ( though with a C - to - C cable you ' d probably still be able to charge your buds ) Overall , this phone get ' s my highest recommendation .

The body and screen are decent , however , the speaker quality is so dismal I am considering to selling it . 4a is at least a decent ( ish ) value for money and the camera punches above its weight . I initially got Pixel 5 but had to sell it because it had very much the same issues except it cost $ 650 . The whole experience of 4a is very imbalanced . I miss the audio quality and materials of my Samsung Galaxy S7 every minute and that is a five year old phone . The drop in quality is shocking . If you use the phone as a phone , something designers at Goggle probably don ' t , you ' ll want to hurl it through the window soon . It is practically unusable as a speaker phone which is something the competition does usually very well . The loudspeaker accentuates any minor issues participants may have with their lines : the one that is a tad too bassy buzzes and sounds hollow , faint lines sound fainter etc . Samsung figured this out years back ! Similarly , you will almost never be able to set the loudness level correctly between ringtones , alarms , media volumes between loudspeaker use and headphone use . Imagine you set your ringtone so that you can hear it in normal use . Then you switch to headphones to play a song . Then someone calls you . Your eardrums will almost explode because the phone is too dumb to adjust for headphones ! Perhaps I am too focussed on the audio quality . But for me it is a key function . There is a lot of hype about Google products but substance is simply not there . Google sells you cheap iron designed by a team who really do not know how to make it work together . And a good camera . However , the competition caught up with the latter as well . I am still considering selling this phone too . Not happy .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1177: If you want to buy an US Android smartphone that has minimal out - of - the - box bloatware , a headphone jack , fingerprint sensor , great camera , and an unlockable bootloader , there is only one phone on the market that meets that criteria , the Pixel 4a . I personally desire these features on my smartphone , but manufacturers have been removing them from their flagship smartphones from sometime . I used to only buy smartphone flagships and was always excited to upgrade . I purchased the first Google Pixel XL on launch day back in 2016 and it has been the best phone I ’ ve ever used . I loved my Pixel XL so much I have tried to replace it twice but ended up selling the newer phones as I considered them to be inferior . My Pixel XL stopped receiving software updates from Google a while back , but I ’ ve been able to extend its lifespan by loading LineageOS on it . Subsequent Pixel flagships have removed several features I want on my phone or added features I did not want . The Pixel 2 series removed the headphone jack , the Pixel 3XL had an ugly notch mimicking the iPhone X , and the Pixel 4 ( non - A ) series does not have fingerprint sensors . It really does not make sense that the Pixel 4a , a budget offering , has more features than the Pixel 4 , but this is the reality we live in . I ’ d like to quickly run over the things I love about this device before I start tearing into with criticism . I love that it has a headphone jack . I have no problem with wireless technology , but Bluetooth in 2020 still provides inferior sound quality when compared to a wired connection . When I ’ m in my car or listening to headphones , I want a wired connection for the best quality possible . Wired headphones also don ’ t require batteries meaning they are much more environmentally friendly and never require battery replacement . I also love that this phone has an unlockable bootloader . If you want to keep this phone past the 3 year window of software support Google offers , you can load an aftermarket ROM on your device like LineageOS . It ’ s also a plus if you want to root your device . Many smartphone manufacturers ( Samsung , Huawei , Motorola , Motorola , to name a few ) either don ’ t allow this or limit the functionality to certain models which I consider unacceptable . Can you imagine if you bought a computer with Windows 7 but were forbidden from loading Windows 8 or Ubuntu on it ? You don ’ t have to imagine , that ’ s essentially what most smartphone manufacturers do . Google doesn ’ t and I appreciate that . While an unlockable bootloader is nice , I would say that most people would like to use their new phones with out - of - box software as long as possible . Google ’ s version of Android is the closest thing to pure / bloatware - free that you can get . There are no duplicate apps ( except YouTube / YouTube Music ) , and almost everything can be uninstalled or disabled out of the box . Mine did come with a T - Mobile app which I saw as strange since it ’ s an unlocked phone , but I was able to uninstall it . This is what I like to see . Other brands such as Samsung have gone as far as to create entire duplicate app stores , calendars , mail apps , assistants , and internet browsers that are not removable from their phones . Others , like OnePlus , now put Facebook services on phones out of the box . I am glad that Google has not embraced these practices and still leaves app choice up to the owner of the phone . The camera , like on all Pixel phones , is fantastic . Great low - light performance and amazing detail , contrast , and color . No other smartphone on the market can compare with the Pixel series of phones when it comes to cameras . Both the front and rear shooters take great shots , but for reasons I ’ ll get to later , I hate the front camera . So what are the compromises ? This thing is cheap , gross , fingerprint - attractive plastic . In all honesty , I hate all plastic . Plastic is what disposable products are made from . I don ’ t want a plastic phone . Make it out of aluminum , steel , glass , whatever . But plastic is not acceptable on any smartphone in 2020 , even a budget one . Immediately when I took this phone out of the box I hated how it felt in my hand . It feels like a kid ’ s tox , reminiscent of the iPhone 5c . You may think this is being harsh on a $ 350 phone but the iPhone SE 2 is made from aluminum and is the same price . The aesthetic design of the phone isn ' t too bad , if it were made of aluminum it would be a nice looking phone , that is , if it weren ' t for what I ' ll get into next . The screen is horrible . It ’ s only 1080p - equivalent ( my Pixel XL from 2016 is 1440p , it ’ s not wide enough for my taste , and rather than have a bezel on the top of the phone like on the Pixel 4 , Google instead decided to embrace the hole punch - style front camera design popularized by Samsung . Whenever you look at this phone , you are going to see this camera . It sticks out like a sore thumb , a giant black mark on the screen . It ’ s even worse when you ’ re watching videos in portrait mode , as the top of the display darkens to simulate an artificial bezel . If the video you ’ re watching is dark then rather than seeing the beautiful perfect black scenes you can achieve with an OLED screen , you see the camera . It ’ s also a distraction when you ’ re viewing a wide photo or video in landscape mode , it ’ s a giant black dot on the side like a fly landed on the screen . I spend a lot of time watching videos on my phone and this is not acceptable . When in dim rooms the camera hole is also very reflective and will shine light right into your eyes , adding further distraction . The only thing I can compliment is that at least the hole is off to the side and not in the center . It ’ s still terrible . I ’ m not happy with the fingerprint sensor . It ’ s plastic so it feels terrible , but it also doesn ’ t seem to read fingerprints well . To its credit it does read quickly , much more quickly than my Pixel XL , but I find myself having to read my print three or four times just to get it to unlock . I prefer optical under - screen fingerprint sensors such as those found on the OnePlus series of phones but can accept a rear fingerprint sensor if it ’ s accurate and quick . The sensor on the 4a does not seem to be accurate . The battery is too small at 3140mah . There are budget Indian and Chinese phones that are packing 4000mah + batteries into smartphones of similar size , Google is lagging behind the competition . They ’ ve advertised this as having “ adaptive ” battery optimization and while it seems to perform fairly well out of the box , how well will it perform after several major updates and a few hundred charge cycles ? One of my last jobs was spent working with batteries and one of the things I learned is that when it comes to lithium - ion cells , higher capacity + lower discharge depth = longer lifespan . Even if this phone can get you through morning to night with 10 - 15 % capacity left of a 3 , 140mah battery , you ’ ll be left with a battery lasts less long than if you had a 4000mah battery ending the day at 30 % before going back on the charger . Lithium - ion cells also degrade as they ’ re cycled . After 100 cycles a Lithium battery can lose as much as 5 % - 10 % of its capacity . If you start with a larger cell then that degradation will be less of an issue as age sets in . Needless to say , Google fumbled on battery size . I think this is the best new Android phone on the market , but in the same breath , I think that reflects poorly on the Android smartphone market . You might think my criticisms are harsh considering the low price of the phone , but I did not buy this phone because it was cheap . I bought it because it has the features I want . If I had the option of buying a flagship smartphone with a headphone jack , fingerprint sensor , metal / glass body , excellent camera , large battery , no hole punch , and no bloatware , I would buy that . I can ’ t buy a new flagship smartphone like that so this is the next closest thing . I ’ m not even asking for luxury features like wireless charging . Basically , I feel no guilt in being critical towards the device ’ s flaws because my desires as a consumer are not being met by the companies I ’ m purchasing from . I would recommend this device if you need the features it has .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1183: This phone was purchased after extensive research and positive first hand experience with the Pixel 3a . After several weeks of waiting for the new phone to ship after it was released , I am very pleased with the functionality of this new Pixel 4a . One of the biggest selling points for this phone is the price . I didn ’ t want to finance another $ 800 phone from Verizon so I opted for an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network . This phone was a bargain at $ 349 , but there is nothing cheap about this phone except for the price . The Good : Besides winning on price , this phone was a breeze to set up . The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue . The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly . The Pixel 4a also transferred all data , apps , and pictures from my old Galaxy S7 . It used a USB cable to connect and download everything . Even texts , voicemails , and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost . Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over . Apps needed to be logged into again and there were some forgotten password issues , but nothing that couldn ' t be fixed . Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate . It is a bit different than th 3a and other Android phone as there is no back button and everything is controlled through swipes . It takes some getting used to but works smoothly once you get it down . The camera is outstanding and surpasses any phone previously used . Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features . This battery lasts all day long even with regular use . The battery on the 3a is great and the battery on the 4a is awesome ! It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge takes approximately one hour . The Bad : The bad really isn ’ t all that bad when taken in proper context . There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since it ’ s missing some luxury features . Apparently this phone isn ’ t waterproof , which comes as a surprise to me since I ’ ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water . Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing . It really isn ' t a big deal though since the battery lasts so long this phone is rarely on the charger anyway . This phone does take a USC - C cable so it isn ' t compatible with the cables from older Android and Kindle devices , which use Micro USB cables . It comes with one USB - C cable but you may want to purchase another if you like extra ones around the house or in the car . Again , not a huge deal because of the battery life . Summary : This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users . It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is , making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones . It wins in value , setup , camera , operating speed and battery life . Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have , but those don ’ t weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 4a so I am giving this a strong four stars .\n",

One downside is that it doesn ' t have an SD card slot , but I ' m finding the 128gb \u001b[32m<builtin storage:Positive Confidence:0.9898>\u001b[0m is more than enough for now . I bought this as a replacement for a Motorola Moto Z2 Play phone after the front glass started to separate from the frame . The Motorola was a little bigger than the Pixel 4a ( and a little unwieldy if the truth be told ) but to my mind the smaller \u001b[32m<size:Positive Confidence:0.9403>\u001b[0m of the Pixel 4a makes it easy to handle , certainly one - handed . Though smaller in overall size the whole - screen display of the Pixel 4a seems to be about the same size as that of the Motorola and I find it \u001b[32m<runs:Positive Confidence:0.9853>\u001b[0m a bit faster than the Motorola too .

As someone who was in need of an upgrade on the android side of cell phones , I went with this phone simply because of the various positive reviews a saw of it on YouTube .

I have become used to bigger phones , however , so the small \u001b[31m<form factor:Negative Confidence:0.9833>\u001b[0m ( which is probably better for some people ) is uncomfortable to me . The phone is also CRAZY light , which I ' m not used to at all , and freaks me out every time I hold it because it feels so fragile . The \u001b[31m<camera:Negative Confidence:0.9903>\u001b[0m is . . oddly . . . not particularly impressive . A selfie did do a decent job of a bokeh background but . . . it looked artificial , and nothing compared to a DSLR camera , or even the iPhone portrait mode . Very artificial , and probably not something I will use much . Fingerprint reader on the back is quite good . Nice location , functions well . Because of the small \u001b[31m<size:Negative Confidence:0.8994>\u001b[0m , I might end up giving this to my 10yo , but if it was me , I would want the XL . . . but probably would prefer an iPhone , if I could afford one .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1229: Got the pixel 4a , knowing the battery wasn ' t the best . Camera is excellent , as most reviewers mentioned . But I did not see the following , which would have made me think again about buying it : 1 . NOT AS ' UNLOCKED ' AS YOU THINK . Got the unlocked version , but am still locked into features that cannot be changed . Example : the default on - screen keyboard . Needing a Delete Key , which is not present on the Pixel 4a ' s default , I downloaded a thirdy party keyboard . . . only to learn YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE DEFAULT ON - SCREEN KEYBOARD , EVEN ON THE UNLOCKED VERSION . That alone would have made me go elsewhere , but it is now my 21st day owning this phone , which brings me to : 2 . 15 - DAY RETURN POLICY , NO MORE . If you ' re past the fifteen days of having purchased ( or received , if you ordered it ) , you are S . O . L . You might counter 15 days is not bad , and in fact is quite typical , considering all that could be done with a phone in that period . But this is Google we ' re talking about , and when you see them accepting a non - optimal standard , it ' s probably because that standard makes them more money than they think could be brought onboard by challenging it . 3 . RESTOCKING FEE . Even if you manage to return your phone within the 15 days , you ' ll have to pay for the shipping and a restocking fee . The payment of one is marginally acceptable , IMO , but when you see a company genuinely confident in their product , they ' ll cover both . By only covering one ( or neither ) Google is telling us they get a lot more of these consumer - rejected returns than expected .\n",

I want a phone that is light and small , with a good enough camera . I don ' t play games on my phone so I don ' t need no latest and greatest silicones .

When you turn off one function , it will normally turn OFF others , e . g . , sound , so you never get notices of calls . Biggest advantage is that it is a smaller phone , 5 + by 2 + inches , easier to carry than the nerd 7 \" X 3 \" monsters . I bought it partly for blue - tooth connectivity , which is OK . My LG was 100 % more user friendly . I had bought the Apple LS , but it died within a week , so I went back to Android - - Big Mistake . Now have to eat $ 500 to change , LG does not make the small phone anymore . No one does it seems . My phone hone is used primarily for calls . Do not need an additional pre - installed 45 google apps on the phone that lacks basic functionality . Google does not understand user design = KISS ( Keep It Simple Stupid ) ! ! P . S .

The first con was it was \" released \" at the end of August , yet I didn ' t receive it until September 16th . So not off to a great start . I rarely say negative things about a smartphone but in this case , I feel like there aren ' t enough reviews outlining the issues I encountered with this phone . I ' ll start with the pros Great price Pretty good camera 128 gb of storage 6 gb of ram 3 years of updates Now onto the cons Dim screen . This one surprised me for this to be an OLED screen the brightness was very unimpressive . Especially outside . Battery life wasn ' t nearly as good as advertised . The photo of the screen on time I included was the best I ever got . Not even close to the 7 - 8 hours advertised or in most reviews . The size felt small despite being a 5 . 8 inch screen . To me this is a con because of my vision . Overall this device is good but in my opinion not great for the price . I ultimately sold it pretty quickly . I am a huge fan of Motorola which the setup of the Pixel is almost identical to . Except you pay noticeably more . I got a Moto g fast on cyber Monday for $ 105 which is a much better value for the price . I also was able to get a Samsung galaxy a51 right after I sold my Pixel which is much brighter with better battery life for $ 199 . Point being my advice is look at all your options before buying this device . While it ' s a solid phone , mid range and even some lower end devices are getting really good . And offer as much if not more than phones like the Pixel 4a . The purpose for me doing this review is to potentially help anyone trying to decide whether to get this or not . Hopefully my experience with it will have helped you .\n",

I literally have to press \" clear all \" 3x for the notifications to go away . I also don ' t like that if I ' m on a website that I ' m trying to upload a image to , the phone sends you on a wild goose chase to find your \" gallery \" . By default it brings up \" recent images \" and I think that ' s dumb . You should be able to choose what it defaults to . Even still when you press on \" camera \" it ' ll still take you to another screen that you have to press \" camera \" again just to get to the images you took with your camera . These things can be fixed with software but it ' s super annoying , especiy the notifications . Not to mention I bought a fossil smart watch that runs wear OS and if I check a email from last year , the watch will send me a notification from that email like I just received it ! STUPID !

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1279: The two great things about the pixel are it ' s price point and camera . Everything else including proper camera controls was forgotten . The main issue is the screen sensitivity , I have medium sized hands and fingers ( size 9 - 10 ) and am quite adept at typing but I felt like I was losing my mind and motor skills trying not to fat finger this keyboard even at its tallest and least cluttered setting . I tried typing the same sentences on different devices and would have 4x the amount of errors on that keyboard . It does help to remove the glass screen protector but then you lose that layer of protection . Most of the new features and controls advertised are either novelties , poorly implemented , or downright dysfunctional . The gesture controls are chaotic . Basically making the entire edge of the screen a very sensitive swipe to go back which is more like the slightest touch will trigger it . Trying to scroll down through a long article . . . nope you triggered the back button and now you have to reload the page or app . Want to pass the phone to someone to show them a photo , nope either of you will likely trigger that back command and they ' ll wonder what you were trying to show them . So I switched back to the old 3 button layout but wait . . they put a button for Live Transcription right next to the Square \" Overview \" button so there have been many occasions that I unknowingly triggered it and drained my battery transcribing a walk through the woods or me muttering to myself while editing or programming . I use a lot of Google Home devices and it is getting annoying to have to avoid using the world Google like your saying Voldemort in some Rowling novel or else you get cursed with the Assistant trying to search for or make a music selection based off of a snippet of your completely unrelated conversation . Finally that lovely little camera has the worst most non - intuitive controls I have ever used on a phone . Sure you can get some great astrophotography shots but you have to turn on Night Sight mode and hope that the camera detects stars or something to trigger the mode . Yes you can ' t shoot astrophotography unless the phone thinks that is what you want . Try fighting phone controls in the late evening in 20 degree Yosemite park and you ' ll wish you had a DSLR with actual buttons so you can keep your gloves on , touch screen gloves are thin and don ' t work well due to aforementioned sensitivity issues . Switching between camera modes requires a swipe and then some have a popup so to go from Portrait mode to Slow - mo you have to carefully swipe over a couple icons and then touch one of the options that appears above video all with a very temperamental screen . It is not fun especially when your cat is being adorable and you miss shots . I also have a feeling this phone will be quickly unsupported by Google as they are already releasing things for the 5 and 5g models that aren ' t available for this one . Then it seems like they are randomly and silently removing features as well . For now I am going back to my old phone ( a very unsupported , cracked , and dull LG G6 ) and now being both burnt out from the new Pixel / Android mobiles and the IOS options , I may just relieve myself of the burden of carrying a smart phone and go for a simpler approach .\n",

Everything , the \u001b[32m<size:Positive Confidence:0.9982>\u001b[0m , \u001b[32m<screen:Positive Confidence:0.9984>\u001b[0m , \u001b[32m<performance:Positive Confidence:0.9985>\u001b[0m ( no lag ) , call and \u001b[32m<speaker quality:Positive Confidence:0.9991>\u001b[0m , \u001b[32m<bluetooth:Positive Confidence:0.9988>\u001b[0m and \u001b[32m<WiFi connectivity:Positive Confidence:0.9991>\u001b[0m , \u001b[32m<3 . 5 mm jack:Positive Confidence:0.9991>\u001b[0m , \u001b[32m<battery life:Positive Confidence:0.9991>\u001b[0m , and of course the \u001b[32m<camera:Positive Confidence:0.9989>\u001b[0m are all outstanding . I ' m extremely happy with this . I also bought the Crave case and OMOTON screen protectors . I look forward to a couple years of good service until I upgrade to the next version . If you need a great Android phone stop sitting on the fence . This is it .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1283: First off , I just wanna say that this view is from the point of view of an AVERAGE BUYER . All the reviews by people who review phones for a living are not accurate for someone like me to decide if I want to purchase this phone . These people are way harsher than the average smartphone buyer ! Some people say this is a “ budget ” phone , but this is the most expensive phone I ’ ve ever owned . A lot of thought went into buying it , and I ’ m so glad I did ! Camera : WOW . Just wow ! This camera has the cleanest and sharpest image I ’ ve ever seen in person on a smartphone . I ’ m attaching some of my favorite photos it ’ s taken . So much DETAIL ! ! I included some photos of my dog and cat because I absolutely LOVE the amount of detail . And one photo of people to see how the selfies look ! ! Battery life : this phone ’ s battery life is very impressive . I usually only charge my phone over night so it ’ s ready to go the next day . I have owned this phone for almost 4 months and I have yet to charge it more than once in a 48 hour span . And the charger that comes with it charges my phone SO FAST . It ’ s unlike anything I ’ ve ever seen . Size : I absolutely love how much smaller this phone is compared to the past 4 phones I owned ! It ’ s still a decent size but it actually fits in my jeans pocket . The screen size makes up for it because it takes up literally the entire front of the phone . Overall : I know this review lacks a lot of key features for this phone and it definitely doesn ’ t do it justice . But overall this phone is amazing and I would buy it again . This is my first Google phone and I ’ m impressed ! Go for it ! !\n",

So far , there are things I really like and things I ' m getting used to having to live with . The \u001b[32m<battery life:Positive Confidence:0.9937>\u001b[0m is amazingly long . I do not have busy days and I do not use my phone all day . Battery life is approximately 4 days ! The hardest thing to get used to is no back button . Learning how to navigate takes a little time . But , it ' s going well and is easy to learn . Happy with my choice , so far . It ' s been good enough that my husband also bought one .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1288: An important smartphone release at a time when there seems to be a real shift away from flagship devices and a move toward mid range value propositions . And with the global economic challanges ahead , the release of the Pixel 4a could be a watershed moment . The form factor is ideal for me . Whilst I understand the benefits of larger screens , the tradeoffs are too big IMO . The 4a is just so easy to handle and carry and it is so light ! The pure Android is a plus . I have had bloatware on my previous two devices ( Huawei ) so it is a welcome change . The option to ' pause ' apps is great too . Battery is good . Easily a full day . I now have battery saver mode set to auto - enable at 75 % and can get 1 . 5 days of moderate usage . I have not had a chance to use the camera much at all but can say that the colours are an improvement over my Huawei P30 and so is the video stabilization . The P30 has an excellent camera with some advantages over the 4a but I like the results from the 4a more . As an aside , the P30 was a form favourite of mine , the best smartphone I had owned . Ticked a lot of boxes including its compact for factor . It edges the 4a on performance ( the 4a does suffer from occasional lags and stutters ) and has a few extra features like face unlock and onscreen fingerprint reader . But the 4a has nudged in front of the P30 , albeit only slightly . Anyway , I am sold on the 4a . It delivers in spades . I don ' t need wireless charging nor do I drop my phones in water . I don ' t need a 90 + hz display ( the 4a ' s OLED display is excellent BTW ) nor do I need facial recognition . I like having the option of a headphone jack though and I like having extra money to spend on other things in life . I have purchased the Spigen Rugged Armour case which provides excellent protection .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1289: Don ' t like how some of the \u001b[31m<google:Negative Confidence:0.6971>\u001b[0m updates have changed things . Otherwise pretty good phone at fair price .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1292: This is my second Pixel phone , I bought this to replace my 3A just to get more memory , and gave the 3A to a friend . I think there is an advantage to buying the phone made by the same company that makes the operating system . You get updates first and everything in the \u001b[32m<Android:Positive Confidence:0.996>\u001b[0m system works perfectly for the most part . The \u001b[32m<camera:Positive Confidence:0.971>\u001b[0m is really quite amazing for a single lens camera . Extras like \u001b[32m<Google:Positive Confidence:0.9774>\u001b[0m lens which lets you photograph anything and turn it into a web search is great . My only complaint is the voice to text function for texting is not very good . I had a low priced LG that worked far better in this area . I constantly have to go back and make corrections and replace misheard words . I have searched for a solution to this problem and have not found it . That is my only complaint . Otherwise I love the phone .\n",

I use a OnePlus 8 as my daily driver and was excited to try this Pixel 4a out . I knew that it had rave reviews for the camera and it absolutely blows my OnePlus 8 out of the water . Otherwise , the device runs smoothly for most tasks . I am used to the 90hz screen , so the 60hz is definitely noticeable on the Pixel 4a . However if you have never had a phone with 90hz or don ' t have a clue what I am talking about , you won ' t notice a thing with the Pixel 4a . : ) Other great features include the size . Yes , I have a 6 \" plus phone and I absolutely LOVE this smaller sized Pixel . So easy to carry and to use . I also love the fingerprint reader . It works super well and is accurate probably 95 % of the time . . . even more possibly . What ' s not to like ? I am not a big fan of the plastic feel , but that is to be expected with a device at this price point . I am also not big on the real life battery life . It was great for the first week of just using as a camera , but it started to even out with my OnePlus , but with much less usage than the other . It does have relatively fast charging though , so there ' s that . All in all , for the money you ' re not going to find a much better device yet . There are things coming that may meet or exceed this , but for the moment I am a strong believer in the Pixel 4a .\n",

I am still struggling a bit with closing \u001b[31m<apps:Negative Confidence:0.9989>\u001b[0m and pages . Sweeping up or down , left or right , I don ' t see which way is right .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1296: The phone itself is absolutely amazing , performance is great , even though some reviewers are saying that it is falling behind some other competitors , I haven ' t really noticed any hiccups or lags while using the phone and apps almost always stay open in the background unless I open like 20 of them . I don ' t really play games on my phone but I think it will handle most games with ease unless u want to play on max settings . Screen is really really good , I came from a samsung so I know what a good amoled screen feels like and this one is great , even at this resolution the image and the color accuracy is really sharp , could have been a little brighter though , but haven ' t really bothered me its good enough even in the sunlight . Camera is absolutely amazing , especially at this price point , its flagship class . Night mode is absolutely amazing . Takes amazing pictures , sharp and color accurate . Video recording is great as well . The only downside can be considered the fact that sometimes when you take a pictures it takes like 2 - 3 second to process it , but other than that it is really really good , like one of the best . Many people say that the holepunch camera cutout is annoying , but it is in a such a spot that it disappears in use , even during watching videos and movies . I almost never notice it while watching content or browsing , unless I absolutely have to see an info that is written on that corner . Battery , the probably the only downside of this phone , you might be like why ? well because it is inconsistent , it can last you with the same exact use on most days for like 6 and even 7 hours ! but on others it might last 3 or 4 , I don ' t understand why is the battery like this , from what I have researched in background it runs some kind of android system process that bottlenecks it from time to time . But overall I would rate it 4 stars , would have been 5 if it was not like this . Fingerprint scanned is , well really really fast , almost instant , but like other fingerprint scanners , if your fingers are wet it wont recognize them , but its like this on like 90 % of others phones which I have used with this feature so It doesn ' t really bother me . Build quality is good , I don ' t mind the plastic back because it feels really good in your hand , its smooth and not slippery , it is really nice to hold it in hand , but as most other users I have a case on it . Other google features really make this phone a good experience , for example the music recognition and others . Overall this phone is a solid 4 . 7 out of 5 , as I said the battery can be a mix bag but other than that it is great . I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants a good phone , which has some good features , amazing camera , good battery life on most days , nice screen , good performance and solid , nice feel in the hand . Especially at 350 $ dollars it is a steal .\n",

And this isn ' t with light use ; I ' d say the same might be true for you . 5 ) The ergonomics of the phone make it easy on the hand to hold . It rarely falls out of my hand , unlike the Note10 + .

The Apple phone features software that is much less of a privacy / security problem than the Google phone . This is true for the Android operating system , which is designed to spy on you . It is also true of the Google app store , which is a cesspool of creepy software . This phone from Google replaces an ancient iPhone that our teenager is using . Her transition from iPhone to Android went smoothly . She reports that \" The interface is easy to use and very elegant . The functions are all well organized and easy to find on the screen as well . The camera captures clear and beautiful pictures . \" With Android phones such as this , getting big software updates can be a problem . Your phone carrier might prevent it , and the phone maker may also prevent it . Choosing an Android phone from Google itself might prove to be an advantage . With a Google phone , you also lose a layer of low quality software from the phone carrier and the phone maker . Honestly , I really dislike Android but this phone is a very nice piece of work . It is a solid value as well .\n",

I always get the newest iphone every year , but have dabbled in android phones a handful of times , the last being the exploding Note phone by Samsung . Lately I ' ve felt utterly bored by iOS and apple in general . Every iteration feels like the same thing over and over for more and more money . I started questioning whether I truly needed a $ 1 , 000 cell phone , especially a brand new one every year . I feel that flagship phones are at a point of diminishing returns . I don ' t game on my cell phones much , and there ' s nothing I ' m doing that needs $ 1k worth of hardware to accomplish . Youtube , texting , internet browsing , occasional Twitter use makes up the majority of my consumption . I started browsing what current android phones are offering once I made the decision that I was going to leave Apple and ios behind . First I looked at Samsung , but quickly realized that they are essentially the Android version of Apple , very expensive and flashy , but not offering simplicity . After some more browsing of Sony , motorola , oneplus etc , I came upon the Google Pixel line . Pixels are not flashy , they don ' t fold in half , they don ' t have super ultra extreme warp charging . What they offer is a simply attractive phone , with unalulterated , bloatware - free Android OS , monthly security updates , day one major android updates , regular \" feature drops \" and , for the Pixel 4a anyway , awesome battery life . The 4a is a no - frills , budget phone that punches way above it ' s price tag , and performs unlike what I thought a \" budget \" phone would feel like . I very much enjoy having a fingerprint reader again , and the headphone jack is a pleasant addition , though I don ' t use it much it ' s nice to know it ' s there if I need it . 5g isn ' t and won ' t be available in my rural new england area likely for years , so it ' s nice to not pay extra for a feature I ' ll never miss . Simply put , this is THE phone to get if you want an inexpensive but strong - performing experience . For $ 350 , this phone cannot be beat .\n",

My wife contacted support and was told to send it in and it would be fixed under warranty . However , after they received it they went back on the warranty coverage . They said the phone screen was cracked ( the phone has been in a case and has a screen protector ) . In the initial call to support we had sent photos of the phone to show the screen issue , none of which show any kind of screen crack . My wife requested photos of the cracked screen to which out agent \" Irene \" would not provide as it is in a different department . Irene then told us she would call back after a day or two to help further resolve the issue . After a few days we don ' t hear back so again we call in . The next agent can ' t do anything because it is Irene ' s case . We ask for a supervisor to which we are told they are in a meeting . We request a call back from a supervisor and are told to expect a call within 24 - 48 hours . Instead of calling us back Irene send us an email saying we have til the 16th to decide what we want to do , phone returned to us more damaged than before or pay for a new screen . We respond to the email that we were originally told it was covered by warranty and have had a very frustrating experience and we would like to get a call back from a supervisor . Again , Irene goes silent and doesn ' t respond . We receive no call backs as promised so we call in again the next day .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1402: So I was slightly skeptical about this phone . Some of the reviews worried me a bit . I did a month worth of research on finding the perfect budget phone for myself . Everything was pointing to the pixel 4a . I unfortunately didn ' t do enough research with my last phone which was the moto g7 . I absolutely loved the g5 and just assumed I would love that one as well , and no I didn ' t . So this was like a really nice upgrade for me . I usually use a phone for at least 2 years and couldn ' t get past a year with that one . So I ' m a heavy phone user from streaming , games here and there , camera and social media . I ' m not some tech genius but I do my research . Let me tell you some things I love about this phone . Standout Pros - - The price ! - The camera , it ' s absolutely fantastic . I can ' t get over how much I love it . My photos on my old phone were terrible . Now I can ' t stop taking pics . - Minimal bloatware . Not a whole lot is preloaded onto this phone which is great . - How light it is . Old phone was so heavy my hand would fall asleep . This is a great weight . - The features , I love some of the great things this phone can do . Such as the picking up of music around you . There are a bunch of things I really enjoy but just go watch a good review on youtube if you want to see them all . Cons - - Extremely crappy case selection lol . Literally that ' s the only con I have so far and it ' s a small one . Although I do have to say that everyone was raving about the pixel 4a ' s battery life . And I have to say it ' s pretty good . It ' s about the same as my old phone . It ' s not insane as I thought it was going to be . It ' s not a con because it ' s not bad in any way . Just thought I would mention it ' s not as mind blowing as it was made out to be . Also I thought I ' d mention that my old phone had a 6 . 2 inch screen and this is obviously smaller . I don ' t even miss or notice the smaller screen . I was a little hesitant on the smaller screen of the pixel . But almost immediately I didn ' t even notice the difference . I actually enjoy having a slightly smaller phone . The shipping was great from this seller as well . These were just a few Standout things from an average person like me . I use my phone for absolutely everything and a quality phone is extremely important . I look forward to using this phone for 2 + years at least . I hope some of this helps anyone on the fence !\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1407: I had the Pixel 3a XL prior to ordering this phone , but my wife needed a better phone , so I ordered this one and gave her my 3a XL as she wanted the larger size . My biggest concern was the screen size difference , but with the slim bezels on the 4a , the overall screen size is really not much different when compared to the 3a XL . You can see a slight difference when you hold them side to side , but in practical terms of use , its very neglible . As for the phone itself . . . I love it ! It has the awesome camera I have come to love with the Pixel lineup , the fingerprint reader is still in place , it has more memory and RAM than the prior model and the size is much more manageable than the 3a XL was . While I do have very large hands , the smaller physical size of the phone is just much easier to handle , and much easier to operate one handed . Prior to my Pixel 3a XL , I had the Huawei Mate 10 Pro - which I absolutely loved . I have also had Nexus and Galaxy phones , as well as a few other more budget friendly phones . For the MONEY - this phone is an absolute slam dunk ! Everything you need , nothing you don ' t . Full Transparency - I am not a gamer , so I can not attest to how it holds up in heavy gaming . But beyond that , it works wonderfully . If there is any downside , it is the battery . Not that it ' s small . . . I have gotten through all day on more than one occasion . However , with my slightly more than average use , I do find myself needing to top off late in the evening . The good news is that in as little as 15 mins , this thing will charge up 50 % or more , so it ' s not a huge deal . If you are going to go out for the evening , just plug it up while you are getting ready , and you ' ll be more than good to go ! They claim that the adaptive battery software will continue to optimize the phone ' s battery life over time , so we ' ll see how that goes . But despite that , it is still a phone I would recommend ALL DAY LONG , especially when comparing to other phones in this price point . Oh , and having just one color choice ? ? What does that really matter , especially when virtually all of us put some sort of case on the phone . There ' s a good variety of cases to add color , so don ' t let that stop you .\n",

Sure , it doesn ' t have a few features I was hoping it had , but the honest truth is . . . did I really need them ? For the price ( $ 350 at the time of this review ) there simply isn ' t anything remotely close in my opinion , and I am truly enjoying the experience with this . The fingerprint reader is just practically instant , and the placement on the back is the right place for it . I always hated the Samsung ' s button fingerprint reader , and it seemed like a crap - shoot whether it would work or not . this one is just darn solid . Camera is great , and the battery life is just unbelievable . Unless you - absolutely - need some of the missing features , like the wireless charging , wide - angle camera or the faster - refresh rate , then this is the one to get . If you do feel like you need those , do make sure you ask yourself if they are worth paying over 2x the cost of this phone for them . . . This isn ' t just a great phone for $ 350 , it is a great phone full stop , and if this is the feature set and performance I can now expect at this price point , I will never shell out $ 1k + for a phone ever again . I didn ' t get it through amazon as it was sold out , but I also got the google branded case and that one is also fantastic and highly recommended .

I like the fact it has 128gb of internal memory so no need for an internal micro sd card . Great camera too . I like you can set it to block out telemarketers .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1423: For the price ( being about a third of current big name flagship phones ) this phone is a great option . But , there are a few things missing that I wish it had . As an amateur photographer , I like having a phone that can fill in for ( or replace ) a pocket camera for those everyday pictures when it isn ' t convenient to carry a full size DSLR . So the good news is that while the camera isn ' t quite as nice as some of the most expensive phones out there , it ' s easily as good as most pocket cameras as recently as just a few years ago . You will not be disappointed with the results from this camera . But that does lead into one of the phone ' s drawbacks , the lack of a micro SD card slot . Without one , you are limited to the internal storage of the phone itself , and once that is full , you ' ll need to backup your files and delete them from the phone to make room . With 128 GB of internal storage , most casual users will not run out of space quickly , however , unless you are recording tons of videos all the time . The lack of a removable card slot is mitigated somewhat by the inclusion of a USB OTG adapter that will allow you to attach a thumb drive or other USB accessory to the phone . This will let you easily backup your files to an external drive to free up space on the phone , if it becomes necessary . It also allows you to easily connect USB accessories and peripherals like a keyboard or projector , for example . The screen is a good size , extending almost to the edges ( but not quite wrapping around like a Galaxy phone ) . The rear facing \" selfie \" camera is embedded in the screen , so that ' s a nice modern styling touch common to other current generation phones . The front facing camera and flash LED light are housed in a pod on the back of the phone which protrudes approximately 1 . 5mm from the back surface . This is sort of an unsightly break in an otherwise smooth , aesthetically pleasing housing . I am sure the aftermarket will step up with phone cases that protect this little pod from dings and scratches . The screen itself curves down at the edges to meet a thin plastic bezel to transition into the plastic case back . Additionally the fingerprint scanner is conveniently located in the center of the phone back where your index finger naturally lands when holding the phone . Every other phone I have used has had occasional scanning errors but this one has unlocked easily every time . I ' m not sure if that means it would be easy to fool the scanner , but it is undoubtedly more convenient and so far is the best fingerprint scanner I ' ve used on a phone , so Google really nailed this feature . The speakers sound a little hollow when held in the hand listening to music , but they improve when the phone is laid on a hard surface like a desk . There is a TRRS audio in / out jack so you can connect headphones , speakers , a microphone or a speaker / mic headset , among other things . Some niche apps ( like certain amateur radio apps ) require this jack so it ' s good that it ' s present . Actual phone audio is excellent . I simply swapped my micro sim out of my old phone and into this one and it immediately recognized it and is able to make and receive calls as if nothing changed . I get no complaints about low volume or poor sound from people on the other end of the line either . Another feature I miss from my old phone is WiFi calling . This allows you to make and receive voice calls over a WiFi router when a phone network connection is unavailable . It ' s a great feature that I have found very useful many times , but sadly it doesn ' t appear to be present in this phone ( at least , not on the OEM phone app ) . Screen clarity , color and resolution are all too good to complain about . Touch sensitivity is good . Like most phones in the last 5 years or so , there is no way for the end user to easily replace the battery . And with the rapid development of Android , your phone ' s processing power will probably be obsolete before you significantly wear out the battery . I typically charge my phones every night and take them off the charger in the morning . I ' ve had phones last for 3 years , but that was the absolute longest I ' ve managed to go before upgrading . And by that time my old phone was struggling to run the current Android build . Still , I really , really wish modern phones still had a provision for changing the batteries . Okay , so what else ? It ' s a Google phone so you are going to get a cleaner version of Android than you would on a Samsung or other brand because there isn ' t going to be as many bloatware apps . It doesn ' t have a Qi charging coil inside so you won ' t be able to use wireless charging . This is a feature I liked from my other recent phones because you can put a little piece of tape over the USB port to keep pocket lint from getting in , and just charge it wirelessly . With the 4a , you ' ll have to plug it in to charge it , and that means the plug will have to be open to the elements . Overall it ' s a really nice phone when considered on its own . When compared to other phones ( costing a lot more ) it lacks some features , but for the price you get a lot of great features and functionality . If you are looking for an android phone that checks almost all the boxes and will save you a lot of money versus a flagship phone , this is a solid choice .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1428: When I dropped our old mobile phone service to move to Project Fi , new compatible phones were necessary . The Pixel2 had just come out and was my choice to replace my family ’ s phones . The monthly phone bill was very low compared to our old service and a year ’ s worth of the savings paid for our phones . After two years , we upgraded to Pixel 4XL sets . When need arose for an additional phone , I again researched available options , ultimately choosing the Pixel 4a . Admittedly , I wanted something less expensive than another 4XL , plus size appropriate for smaller hands with a good camera and no degradation in performance . The 4a has been a perfect choice . It ’ s smaller and easier to hold . The camera seems to be the equal of its bigger counterpart ’ s much acclaimed camera . Not everyone loves the feature , but I ’ m partial to phones with a fingerprint sensor on the back , like on the 4a . Something else I don ’ t see all the time on inexpensive phones is the ability to make contactless payments ( NFC ) . Old style headphones are compatible too with the 4a ’ s headphone jack . At this price , it wasn ’ t a surprise , or very disappointing , to learn that the phone isn ’ t rated as water resistant . I highly recommend Google Fi phone service and Google Pixel phones . Considering the savings , compared to high - end Android phones , the 4a is an intelligent choice for anyone that wants most of the perks of the bigger sets in a less sexy package ( plastic versus glass ) . Five stars .\n",

The screen doesn ' t always respond ( I try to expand from my home screen to view all apps , but it won ' t expand ) .

I trained \" ok google \" for my voice , but it never works , however when I was listening to an audiobook in the car , for some reason the name \" Able \" activated google voice every time - super annoying . The first day , the alarm clock didn ' t go off ( found out this is a known issue ) , and I was late for work . The top volume on the speaker is laughably quiet , so don ' t expect to be able to talk on speakerphone in the car .

The * 82 unblocks my caller ID so the friend can see it ’ s me calling . This does not work on the Pixel 4a that I had . If I make the call with the * 82 prefix the number still shows up as blocked or restricted . Spent a couple of hours with Google chat trying to resolve the issue to no avail . Also contacted T - Mobile with same results . The other issue was the adaptive charging which was enabled on the phone . Alarm set for 8AM and charging began after 9PM . Screen would show “ Adaptive Charging ” but would still fast charge the phone within an hour . Again used Google chat but was never able to get the adaptive charge to work .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1436: I love this phone . Please keep in mind , I ' ve never owned a flagship phone , usually sticking to phones I could buy outright for less than $ 200 . That said , I was ready for a new phone and did a lot of research . I also had a chance to spend some time with a Pixel 4 to compare it . So the following are my impressions : First off , what ' s different from the Pixel 4 : You are missing the aluminum frame , the facial recognition , the edge squeeze , the water resistance , a specific camera lens and some camera features , wireless charging , and an 800 series processor . I think that ' s about it . The thing is , other than the water resistance , I personally don ' t miss any of that . What you get in return is a slightly bigger screen , a better battery , and a brighter screen ( you have to use adaptive brightness for it to work ) . This is also a fair bit lighter . Also a personal preference is that I prefer the fingerprint reader over facial recognition . For me it ' s the perfect little phone . Full disclosure , I paid about $ 260 since I bought it from Amazon Warehouse . Nonetheless , this phone hits all the right spots for me . It is light , it has a clear and bright screen , it is fast , takes amazing pictures , it isn ' t bloated with preinstalled apps , and is future proof in that you can update for 3 years , the sound is pretty great , and honestly I can ' t find much to complain about . The only thing I wish this had was the water resistance . Accidents happen . Also keep in mind that this is plastic with an outdated Guerilla 3 screen . Buy a case . Buy a screen protector . If you do , I can ' t see why this phone won ' t be a great phone for you unless you only buy the $ 1000 flagships with all the bells and whistles , in which case , why are you even reading this review ? One last thought . The battery is fine by me . I can make it through the day and longer with moderate use . No wireless charging , but it charges from zero to full in pretty much less than an hour , so I always find time within the day to plug it in and then I ' m good to go . Usually at dinner time or whatever when I don ' t want to be disturbed anyway . Had a chance to to go with the Pixel 4 , chose to go with this instead ( mostly because the Pixel 4 screen is waaaaay to dim ) . Thanks Google for this amazing cheap phone !\n",

With this phone I am amazed , I get nicely exposed and clear pictures in all light levels . I use my phone to document items and even documents using the photo scan app and it works perfectly . I couldn ’ t have done that with Moto it just wouldn ’ t happen the camera and app on Motorola is horrible and I got no help from Motorola at all it ’ s a defect numerous people have . With this camera I have none of that the pics are just crystal clear and I don ’ t have to stand on my head and pray just for a good pic . Thanks Google . I like google everything it just works ! Thank you ! I can get perfect pictures for my reviews on Google maps and Amazon etc . I couldn ’ t do that before ! The camera is important to me because I don ’ t carry my big digital camera anymore it ’ s just to much hassle . I want a nice clear picture taking camera that ’ s easy to use and quick ! I use the camera more than phone calls and text so I really love this phone ! I find that the camera functions can do very extensive things and for once they are easy to use which I didn ’ t have before . Google please keep it up make a camera that is good and easy to use and just works ! I haven ’ t commented on the actual phone functions as I just live for the camera ! I use it to document my old pictures and convert them to digital and store them on Google Photos , love it . I ’ ve done the old way trying to store on a desktop computer on hard drives , discs and flash drives and a scanner . Not anymore I had to re digitize my old paper pictures to google and I can access them effortlessly using Google Photos . I ’ m sold , I use Google for everything now . I ’ m 65 and this digital apps , camera phone and Google pics is just so much easier to do . The camera itself works excellent and menus are so much better and easier to use .

Dropped it once , no damage . Fingers crossed . ( I don ' t use face recog or fingerprint reader ) GREAT price ! CONS A bit too narrow Display is not as good as the reviews would have you believe Ditto on the camera - - I ' m not very happy with it . The controls are clumsy , including the exposure hotspot . I really miss the Turbo 2 ' s \" wave your hand \" to see notifications . Seems to me this would be easy to implement on all phones .

The only downside I ' ve found is that the \u001b[31m<processor:Negative Confidence:0.9879>\u001b[0m is not as quick as the expensive phones . Everything else about it makes it a great phone .\n",

I bought mine from Google because they had them in stock and Amazon didn ' t at that time . I really like the small size . The camera in this thing is every bit as good or better than my expensive Nikon digital camera . I don ' t know if it ' s the internet service or if it ' s the phone either way this thing is fast . Some people are complaining about having to swipe the screen to navigate so if they ' ll go to settings , then to accessability and then system navigation you ' ll find the old 3 button navigation system that you can switch to . If you take the time and go through all the settings you can find a lot stuff to adjust to make using this phone a lot easier to use . The battery in my opinion is fine . I ' ve been using my 4a since early this morning and its 6 : 42 pm now and I still have 40 percent battery power remaining . I purchased the LK screen protectors for mine here on Amazon and they fit and work perfectly and were easy to install . You can ' t beat the price at $ 9 . 99 for 4 of the tempered glass protectors that include an installation frame , wet and dry wipes , a tool to remove air bubbles and lint picker uppers . They have a good installation video on the LK website . I also purchased a case cover and holster with a belt clip on Amazon . It also fits perfectly . You can find it if you search on Amazon under \" Encased Pixel 4a belt clip case ( thin armor ) slim grip cover with holster for Google Pixel 4a - black \" . They ' re only $ 16 . 99 . The case cover is flexible and it covers the edge of the phone all the way around . The rubber case feels better to the touch than the hard plastic and it ' s not slick .

The 5 . 81 - inch \u001b[32m<display:Positive Confidence:0.9807>\u001b[0m might seem big in the ads , but the small bezels and punch - hole \u001b[32m<camera:Positive Confidence:0.9941>\u001b[0m help make this a truly one - handed phone . I wasnt wishing for a larger phone while scrolling watching videos . I prefer plastic phones , since switching back to plastic from a super - breakable glass phone gave me a sense of freedom I never had with more expensive phones . I didn ’ t even need a case . The phone isn ’ t as slippery , and it ’ s more durable than a glass - covered phone if I were to drop it - altho I didn ' t test this .

It is also to easy to swipe things away when your intentions are to navigate to another text , scroll up or down and choose an item when working with one hand .

My wife had been using an older phone that didn ' t have much memory and was something of a dinosaur in today ' s world . When this became available , we picked it up , even if somewhat reluctant . For us , it ' s been a really smooth transition . As with most gadgets , learning is fairly intuitive and trial - and - error . Set up was easy to link her older android phone to this one . We ' ve never had a Google Pixel phone before and , truth be told , never even heard of them before . Again , for us , the set up was easy ( a huge plus ) , and figuring out how to swipe , use various shortcuts , and essentially learn the phone was a pleasant and rarely frustrating experience . I can ' t tell you how important that is for us . The photographs , as advertised , are very sharp and as good as promised . I ' ll skip the concept of a phone being a great camera , but for us , especially given her old phone ( and my iPhone 6s ) , these are really nice photos . The essentials - the battery life is great and it ' s a quick charge ( as is the case with most new phones ) , we don ' t do facial recognition , and the dimensions are good for her hands . We quickly picked up a case with screen covers , which eased our worries about drops or damages . Since we ' ve had it , we ' ve been really surprised and happy with how easy it is to work with , how much of an upgrade it is , and how easy it ' s been for her to acclimate to .

The \u001b[32m<camera:Positive Confidence:0.958>\u001b[0m is probably the pixel 4as biggest selling point . The funny thing is it isn ' t really the camera itself that makes it good .

I currently have a Mate 10 Pro , Pixel 3a , Galaxy S10e , S20 5G , Note 20 and a Pixel 4a . The S10e has been my all time favorite and the 4a might end up taking the top spot . Positives for me : * Price : $ 350 for a phone that meets or beats phones costing over twice as much . The 4a is a steal at this price ! * Polycarbonate build with matte finish . Whomever thought putting glass on the back of a phone was a good idea must have a sedentary life style . What a dumb idea . \" Oh , but glass feels preeemium \" . Give me a FB . * Light weight : I spend most of the warm months in shorts and I hate having a heavy phone weighing my pocket down . * Beautiful 1080p screen with smooth & fast scrolling , but wish it was 6 . 0 \" to 6 . 2 \" . People go on and on about QHD displays and 120Hz which is great , but these are cell phones people not TV screens . I don ' t care what make phone you have , if you keep your screen on the highest resolution and set to 120Hz your battery will drain at a rapid pace . Add in 5G and you better have a desk job with a plug near by . Cell phone battery technology is not ready for these options and I know because I have had several phones with all three options and they take a lot of juice . * Rear finger print sensor : IMO this is the best way to unlock a phone and the perfect location and the speed of it is perfect . Actually I like the side mounted FP sensor on the S10e a little better and I don ' t understand why all manufacturers don ' t use it or a rear mount . * Battery life is excellent and it charges fast enough . These 40w + chargers some phones use will dramatically shorten battery life , but they do give you the all important bragging rights . I have had over 8 hours SOT on my 4a with brightness set to auto . * 128gb of storage is great and should be more than enough for 90 % of the users . 6gb of ram is perfect and makes this phone as quick as phones costing twice as much and more . * Headphone Jack : I haven ' t used one in over 6 years , but a lot of people do . * Haptics : Pixels have the best haptics and weak rattly haptics can ruin the feel of a phone , but not this one . * Stereo Speakers : They sound very good and sound amazing for the price . Plenty loud . Negatives : None , other than a slightly larger screen would have been nice , but is by no means a deal breaker .\n",

I recommend this as it fits in the palm of my hand .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1526: Though I ' ve only had this Pixel 4a a few days , it has been great so far . The phone came roughly 60 % charged and , as far as I can see , didn ' t require any security updates right away . I was able to open the box and start set - up right away without waiting for charging . The instructions for set - up were good . The box has the cord thingy so you can easily transfer everything from your old Pixel phone to the new one in about 15 minutes or less . It also included a little tool thingy to help get the SIM card out . This was a nice and unexpected bonus that saved a lot of grief . The transfer of everything from the old Pixel to the 4a was smooth and didn ’ t take a ton of time ; the most frustrating part is having to remember your google password , and any other passwords for apps you had on the previous phone . Also some settings needed to be readjusted . As of now , I don ' t seem to have lost anything , though 8 of my contacts transferred without the names . To clarify : the numbers were there in recent texts without a name attached to them but I was able to read the previous texts and determine whose number it was so I could add them as a new contact by using the 3 little vertical dot thingys on each text . I loved my flagship Pixel but knew I needed a new one because the old one wasn ' t being supported anymore and performance was getting slower . I chose the Pixel 4a largely due to the fact that the Pixels don ' t have all the bloatware that comes with Samsung and other brands . I don ' t use FB or Twitter or a lot of those other apps that take up space and not having these unneeded apps on my phone was a huge deal for me . I like having it be our choice whether to put an app on my phone rather than having these forced on us . I also like the Google Keep for notes and the Google Calendar since I had these on previous phones and everything transferred to this Pixel 4a smoothly . Another good factor is the price of the 4a ( this was significant in our decision ) , particularly because it seems to have everything I need and not a bunch of stuff I don ' t need or want . An additional plus is the larger screen ( no bezel ) while still keeping the small size of the phone . The screen looks classy and it ' s small enough to not be a problem getting in and out of a pocket or purse . Everything is faster and smoother than the old Pixel . The plastic hardware isn ' t a big deal to me because I use a solid wallet - case for my phones so protection is provided & people don ' t see the outside of the phone anyway . There are a few nice , new ' bells and whistles ' to learn if you are going from an older Pixel but they are good things and nothing to cause great frustration so far . I ' m still struggling a little with the gesture thingy - and how to double - tap to get recently used apps to come up so we can close them all out . I liked the way we did it on the old Pixel better - but I am adjusting . I ’ m also noticing that the new camera seems to be saving 2 of every cameral shot ( supposedly one is for editing ) and this is annoying because they take up extra space and we rarely edit our photos , so we have to delete the duplicate almost every time . I sure hope Google photos fixes this issue soon . I ’ m hoping this review might help others who are considering an upgrade to the Pixel 4a . Overall , the upgrade from the flagship Pixel ( or Pixel One , or whatever they call it now ) appears to have been a good move .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1531: I had the Pixel 4a for a month in late 2020 , and I generally liked the phone . The most important part that makes this phone great is the price , $ 350 . It ' s not going to get you any top - tier iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra , but it gives you everything the general user would possibly need - a decently fast Snapdragon 730G SOC , 6GB RAM , and 128GB storage . That ' s something that not even the $ 830 base configuration of iPhone 12 gets you . Of course , being $ 350 there are a few things that it misses out on compared to higher - tier phones . One of those things would be the plastic unibody build over something like a metal and glass sandwich . On a phone of this price point it ' s fine , though I did have a bit of plastic creaking near the SIM slot . It was just an annoyance at worst , because the rest of the plastic build felt fine . Wireless charging is also not present , this may disappoint some that used it but it didn ' t bother me cause I never used wireless charging on my iPhone 8 . There ' s no water resistance either , which did raise my eyebrows a bit before I bought the phone but I don ' t submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty places . One thing this does have that the $ 700 Pixel 5 doesn ' t have is a headphone jack . So if you still use anything with a 3 . 5mm plug , this phone has you covered with no need for adapters ! The speakers are also quite good , with one speaker on the bottom next to the USB - C port and one built into the earpiece . As for the software , it ' s got three years of updates which is better than many Android manufactures , but it still won ' t top Apple ' s software support . I did notice a few software bugs when I used it , mainly with YouTube Vanced ' s PIP mode after a certain amount of time . Restarting fixed the issue but it was an annoyance . Hopefully that was just Android 11 and that gets fixed with a future update . Battery life is also pretty decent , better than the aging battery on my iPhone 8 since I could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night . Given that it ' s a small phone by today ' s standards it ' s not going to be a battery life king , but it ' s better than the $ 400 iPhone SE . The size is something I loved about this phone , my hands are relatively small and I like my phone to be pocketable , which is something that I ' m not a fan of with most new phones being over 6 inches in size . The 5 . 81 - inch edge - to - edge screen Is of a similar size to my iPhone 8 and the iPhone X , thus I could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pockets . This is something I ' m sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phones . The camera has been the definition of the Pixel phones since the first ones launched in 2016 . This phone has an amazing single 12MP lens , mostly made great by Google ' s computational photography software . Night mode was very nice to use , as in the scenarios I used it in it helped out take better photos at night . I ' m no expert with cameras so I don ' t know much about white balance , dynamic range , etc . I do like how this phone gives you one great camera as opposed to other manufacturers which give you like seven different pretty - much - useless camera sensors . Overall , this is the phone to buy if you ' re on a budget of less than $ 500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general needs . I would suggest going for the Pixel 4a 5G version if you can afford a $ 500 phone as that has a second ultrawide camera lens , a faster Snapdragon 765G SOC , and as the name says , 5G connectivity . That phone will overall will give you a very very close experience to the Pixel 5 , but if you don ' t have that much to put down for a phone , and if you like the standard 4a ' s smaller size , this phone is the way to go . I highly recommend it and I would personally pick this any day of the week over a similarly priced phone from a China brand like Oppo , Xiaomi , ZTE , Vivo , etc .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1535: I typically buy a \" flagship \" phone every 3 - 4 years until the battery craps out . My last HTC10 went through 3 batteries before I finally cracked the screen and had to buy a new phone . I had been eyeballing the pixels for a while because they don ' t have all the carrier bloat and pre - loaded apps . I was pleasantly surprised to find this had just android with no third party apps burned into the rom . The setup was easy and pulled data from my old phone as well as all the updated versions of the apps from my old phone Battery life is just crazy . The phone came with about 60 % charge . The included fast charger topped it off pretty fast . I wanted to condition the battery by running it way down before recharging a few times . I was kinda shocked that it took almost 3 days to get the phone down to < 30 % with my typical usage . Adaptive battery is on by default , and I typically have about 3 hours of screen time per day , and it hasn ' t had me searching for a charger once . This phone was advertised as having an all day battery and I ' m sure it is true for heavy users . But for those that aren ' t on social media all day , this thing will be running for at least 2 days before you have to charge it . The battery life is just awesome . Also , in the first week my phone took 1 major and 2 minor updates which was nice . All my previous carrier phones would get at most 2 updates over their lives .

My iPhone 7 Plus was getting a little long in the tooth and I ' d been considering an upgrade but even as an iPhone user since the original one , I ' d become a bit turned off by ever increasing pricing on Apple ' s phones . Also , as a product of the Walkman generation I really missed having a headphone jack . Fast forward four months and I ' m using an iPhone 12 Pro Max . . what went wrong ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing . The Pixel 4a is a really great phone . Nice form factor , always on display , fast and responsive fingerprint reader , a headphone jack and frequent updates to its operating system . My only real misgiving is the lack of wireless charging , which is quickly becoming essential to me . This is a great phone that you can customize to your heart ' s content , and if you ' re not entrenched in Apple ' s ecosystem you can probably go ahead and purchase without any reservations . I say ' probably ' , because I felt very ready to pick up and move away from Apple ' s ecosystem , however your circle of friend , family and co - workers should be taken into account . What do the people in your life use ? If it ' s primarily iPhone , that may provide some friction to your transition over to Android . In my case I found that not being connected to iMessage and Facetime was enough of an inconvenience that I was using my iPod Touch to replace the features I no longer had access to on my phone . Silly , right ? That was my conclusion , and I went ahead and bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max . Do I LIKE one more than the other ? I suppose the iPhone 12 does feel a bit more premium , due largely to the fact that it is . . . I don ' t think it ' s a question of ' like ' , though . Your phone is more a question of fit for your life , and as positively as I felt about the Pixel 4a , the fit wasn ' t quite right .

The phone is extremely sensitive to the presence of moisture , and for many of us , it has died in circumstances that any other phone would do just fine in . Mine died when I had it in the pocket of my waterproof ski pants for 2 . 5 hours on the ski slope , on a rainy day .

I can see a very slight haze of humidity on the inside of the selfie \u001b[31m<lens:Negative Confidence:0.998>\u001b[0m .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1569: So I ’ ve been waiting a while for a new phone that has just the right amount of features that don ’ t break the bank . All the things that I was looking for in a phone , the Pixel 4a has them : - At least 6GB of RAM . Check ! - Snapdragon 7XX or better . Check ! - Good camera . Check ! - Android updates . Check ! - Headphone jack . Check ! - Stereo speakers . Check ! - 64GB of UFS 2 . 1 storage or better . Check ! The features that Google spared on the Pixel 4a , I don ’ t think are essential and only serve to drive the price up , this include : - Wireless charging . - Waterproof certification . - Multi - camera setup . - High refresh display . - 5G Network . Here are some phones I was considering : OnePlus Nord For a moment I was thinking about it , as it comes with the more recent Snapdragon 765 SOC , 90Hz refresh display , but the fact that it didn ’ t come with stereo speakers , headphone jack , gimmicky quad camera setup and it ’ s not available in the US was a turn off . Samsung / Moto I was considering also the Samsung Galaxy A71 , but I don ’ t appreciate that it comes loaded with bloatware . Another good contender was the Motorola One Fusion + , but I didn ’ t want to deal with any issues with the pop - up selfie camera . All other Chinese brands were out of the equation , as I don ’ t like their OS UIs , as I prefer the closer to stock Android experience . The Pixel 4a has a very good balance of features in a compact size . PROS - Clean bloatware free software . - 3 years of mayor Android OS updates . - Killer camera with night and astrophotography modes . - Good performance with 6GB of RAM . - Plenty of storage with 128GB . CONS - Battery size : I hope the 3140mAh battery is enough for the needs of tomorrow ( I ’ m upgrading from a similar 3000mAh phone that has degraded to 2784mAh after three years of use ) . - Snapdragon 730 : I can ’ t help to think that the SD765 would be better future - proof , but the 730 will be more than enough if you don ' t game . - No microSD slot to expand storage . I think google has hit a home - run with this one , if you can live with those caveats , just get it ! However if you think you could do a little better , wait a little longer for the Pixel 4a 5G ( revealed on late September / early October ) , as rumors say it will come with Snapdragon 765 , a bigger battery , dual back lens , and 5G for $ 150 more .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1572: Ya ' ll HAVE to be getting paid to write these good reviews because this phone is the worst , most awful \" smart \" phone around . I didn ’ t purchase this phone from amazon , I actually got it from my carrier ( Verizon ) but am writing a review on here because if you ’ re like me you read amazon reviews before purchasing things even if not from amazon themselves . I don ’ t even know where to start . This phone has been complete C R A P from the beginning . The first week I had it , it glitched out so hard IT DELETED EVERYTHING I HAD BACKED UP when it automatically tried to update from android 10 to 11 . Wow , thanks a lot . Thank goodness I had auto sync from my previous pixel 2 turned on and it had about 90 % of my items saved but still , the 10 % ( oh yeah that was ALL OF MY TEXT MESSAGES with scheduling dates , phone numbers and addresses that I needed to get in touch with clients at a later date ) wasn ' t recoverable at all . Really made me look unprofessional having to get back in touch with all of my clients , asking them to resend me the information they had previously sent . Also that didn ’ t include the people I couldn ’ t remember so … I had some missed appointments WHICH COST ME TIME AND MONEY , really really awesome , great job google . Now I paid for this terrible piece of technology in addition to missed appointments fees , GLAD THATS WHAT MY SAVINGS IS GOING TO , THANKS SO SO MUCH . NOW I CANT AFFORD TO EVEN GET A PHONE THAT CAN ACTUALLY DO WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO DO . Moving on . We called verizion , they couldn ’ t figure it out so they sent me an entirely new phone . I figured its a 4 ” a ” maybe there are still some bugs ; technology isn ’ t perfect , stuff happens , whatever , I ’ ll try this again with a new phone I guess . Really don ’ t have any other options considering I had just spent my money on late / missed appointments and this awful phone . JOKE WAS ON ME , the second phone was JUST as bad . My boyfriend is pretty tech savvy and did some research and found that other users on a reddit forum were having similar problems and that it was an error with the new android 11 operating system , so when we got my new 4a , we didn ’ t update the software and kept it on the 10 operating system . Was okay for a while but after about a week the screen started freezing up , locking the screen on whatever I was doing . None of there buttons would work so I just held down the power button until it eventually turned off . I don ’ t use my phone for much , just simple communication and basic social media . I don ’ t have any games , editing apps or anything crazy , literally just social media apps / email and you cut video editor . My phone has never been exposed to any crazy elements , I ’ ve never dropped it , it ’ s never gotten wet , too hot or too cold ; I take exceptional care of my electronics because I ’ m not trying to pay the ludicrous amount they charge for phones these days more than I have to . I take photos and text people on it , thats literally it . NOT ROCKET SCIENCE . We updated the system after a week or so because leaving it on 10 was just not working . As soon as we updated it to 11 , what do you know ? ! ISSUES EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME ! ! ! ! I really don ’ t understand it at all . I ’ m super super super super disappointed I bought this POS . Should have gone with a “ whole ” pixel , not some stupid “ a ” version . Every . Single . Time . I want to use my bluetooth , it NEVER remembers any devices , except for my car somehow ? If I want to connect it to one of the google speakers we have , or stream anything , I have to completely forget the device entirely that I ’ m trying to connect to , EVEN THOUGH IVE CONNECTED TO IT 20 + TIMES , restart my phone , turn the bluetooth on , “ search for a new device ” go through all of those motions , then it works . EVERY TIME I want to use the bluetooth , this is the ONLY way it will work . It freezes up and I have to restart it just about every single day . It constantly disconnects from my headphones so I can ’ t use it to listen to music … . I got new Sony earbuds as a gift which are really amazing but I can ’ t really use them since I have to go through the described process above to connect to even be able to use them , then , it usually disconnects from the headphones after about 20 minutes , for no reason . I feel so silly getting so upset over something like this but I ’ m not exactly wealthy and don ’ t have time or money to waste on stupid crap this “ smart ” phone is doing that literally any other phone could do . I am die hard google supporter , apple isn ’ t my jam but I am considering switching after this phone , this is such a load of baloney , DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME MONEY OR ENERGY ON THIS USELESS PHONE , buy a full pixel or don ’ t get any version of it al all . I ’ m 1000000000000000000 % disappointed that google would release such terrible product , I hate this phone , I really do . I wish I could afford to get a full pixel but I guess I ’ ll just have to wait .

The material and weight of the phone does make it feel \" cheaper \" but it material did have a nice feel to it and the buttons are VERY clicky . The battery life on this phone was AMAZING ! I got close to 34 hours from a full charge . This was a drastic improvement over my Note which barely makes it through half the day now .

My favorite part about the Pixel 4a is actually the Android 11 experience . The Pixel software features are well thought out and really improved my daily interactions . The automatic call screening is a huge relief from the frequent sales and spam calls I would receive throughout the day . The phone would try to suggest a set time for bed to gain better sleep and auto dim , change the color temperature , and adjust the notification settings . The software with the phone feels really polished and it was a wonderful experience to use . Now for the cons . . . One of my biggest issues is Google did not provide an IPX rating for this phone . Yes it is a cheap phone but I do not want to accidentally cause water damage from using it in rain , because we don ' t know its rating ! Other negatives in my opinion are - no face unlock / ID , not IRIS unlock , the fingerprint scanner works well but not perfect especially if it gets the slightest bit dirty .

WHEN this phone works , it ' s a solid phone with a great camera and solid battery life . . . IF it was dependable , it ' d be a good value . But , like all of their handsets to date , know that you ' re taking a risk when you purchase one ( if you don ' t get a dud , you ' ll be happy with this ) .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1612: I was very excited about this phone . I read multiple glowing reviews . Phone arrived yesterday and I ' ve spent several hours with it . I am coming from a 3 - year old Samsung Galaxy S8 . There ' s nothing really wrong with that phone . It ' s just not getting updates anymore and I liked the thought of a pure Android phone . The S8 had some quirks such as a big delay in being able to take a picture while Google Maps was active ( bad for road trips ) . Here are some thoughts / findings about the 4a vs the S8 : 1 . On the 4a I find it a bit frustrating to not being able to close apps as easily as on the S8 2 . The S8 camera has more options - including a pro mode . I think it still takes marginally better pictures than the 4a 3 . The Gboard has a space and down button at the bottom which is impossible to remove . Gboard on S8 does not have this 4 . I find it very easy to hit the back button gesture by mistake on the the 4a and then have to open the app again 5 . I immediately installed a case and screen protector on the 4a , but it still feels like I could easily drop it 6 . The battery life isn ' t that great on the 4a - about the same as the 3 year old S8 I ' d say 7 . Stereo speakers on the 4a is nice - but you have to hold it about a foot away from your face to get the effect 8 . 128 GB of included storage on the 4a is nice ( vs 64 GB on the S8 ) , but I also have a 200 GB SDCard in the S8 9 . 4a gets hot ! It has complained about not being able to do a few things ( transcribe for example ) because it was too hot Jury is still out if it will replace the S8 or not . And if it does replace it , what happens to the old phone ? It ' s only worth $ 100 or less . I ' d say if you were looking for a great phone for the money , and it ' s better that what you currently have , definitely get the 4a as it ' s a good price and has a lot of great features . However , carefully compare it against what you currently have as it might not really be that much better .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1615: I bought the Pixel 4A ( Not the 4A 5G ) to replace a older HTC model which is no longer being updated . Before buying it I looked at other phones and found that most didn ' t get regular OS or Security updates or if they did it was months after the update became available which makes me nervous . When looking at a lot of the other phones I found that most came with built in apps that quite frankly I would never use and more often than not you couldn ' t un install which I don ' t like one bit . The Pixel 4A came with a lot of google apps ( Most of which can be uninstalled which is a breath of fresh air ) and the apps that can ' t be uninstalled like Google assistant ( Which is part of the OS ) can be completely turned off unlike some other assistant apps from other companies which really helps preserve my privacy . I am extremely pleased and pleasantly surprised with the ability to turn things off or uninstall the apps I don ' t want . Unlike many people I don ' t use my phone a lot so I only have to charge it twice a week so batterie life is great ! The phone has worked perfectly since I got it and Over all I am extremely pleased with the purchase ! ! I would definitely reccomend this phone to anyone !\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1616: I was extremely torn between this phone and the Moto G Power ( 2020 version ) . They are both great phones without bloatware , and top of their relative classes , but I ' m very happy I paid more for the Pixel 4a . It ' s smaller , lighter , way better camera , better hardware , more software / security updates , and I prefer Google apps anyway . It has more features than I ' ll use , but not a ridiculous amount like on the Samsung Galaxy S4 I had years ago . I was nervous about battery life , just because I ' m used to having a phone with a ridiculous battery , but there are so many settings that extend your battery life on this phone . There ' s a battery saver mode AND an extreme battery saver mode ! I want this phone to last as many years as possible , so I use the extreme mode all the time time . I don ' t have to charge it but once every 1 - 3 days . If I used the phone more I would probably have to charge it once a day . I like I can unpause specific apps , while leaving the rest in battery save mode . I was nervous about buying a used ( not renewed ) phone on Amazon , especially because the one I purchased was only considered in \" good condition , with minor scratches on front , back , and sides \" . The phone I received is nearly flawless ! I actually didn ' t notice the incredibly minute scratches on the left side , and bottom right corner of the screen for at least 30 minutes out of the box . They ' re so small I thought they were dust . There are no marks on the back or sides at all . I couldn ' t be happier with this phone and I ' m so glad I saved some money buying it used . I can ' t speak for longevity , but my bank gives me a 2yr warranty past a phone ' s release date , and the Pixel only came out Aug 2020 . Seriously get this phone if you like smaller phones , if you need a cheaper phone , I would get the Moto G Power ( 2020 version only ! ) in a heartbeat .\n",

When on the phone , I can only be heard over speaker . After doing some troubleshooting following google instructions , it is determined a microphone issue . Seems like there are some pixel users with microphone problems . I could have brought the phone to an authorized repair shop to have it fixed for free , but I contacted Amazon costumer service first . The representative tried to connect me with a google representative , but was unsuccessful . So it got a replacement . So far the replacement works well .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1619: I ' ve had many Pixel phones and the Nexus 5 that came before . My last phone was a Pixel 3XL so I ' m used to the top of the line flagship - fast , great camera , great display . But this time I decided to go small and affordable and darn if it wasn ' t a great decision ! I ' m really happy with the phone so far . Pros The battery life is WAY better that the Pixel 3XL and I ' ve heard it ' s much better than the Pixel 4 . Nice to have a one handed phone again ! The pics I ' ve taken have been very good - can ' t tell and difference in quality from my Pixel 3 pictures . The screen is sharp and colors bright . It ' s much , much lighter than the heavy phones I ' ve had in the past . Pixels come with Android updates right away and don ' t have all that Samsung or other manufacturer junk apps installed . In all my years of Pixel ownership I ' ve never had a lemon , great reliability . And Google Pixel ' s call screening service ROCKS ! Google it . Not pros No wireless charging . If this is something you need give this one a pass . Water resistant but not waterproof . Not 5G . I personally could give two hoots about 5G , my speeds are fast as they are and I sure don ' t need to pay the mmWave tax for Verizon that makes the Pixel 5 too expensive . Only 1 size , no XL . Plastic back . Mine is hidden by my case so I don ' t care what it looks like and to me it doesn ' t feel cheaply made . Slower processor than Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 . Moving up from a Pixel 3 I have noticed no difference so far , even though my old Pixel 3 is faster I can ' t really tell in normal daily use . If you ' re a heavy gamer or watch a ton of streaming you might want to get the Pixel 5 . Best part , the price for an unlocked Pixel is only $ 349 , such a great deal compared to how much more I paid for the Pixel 3XL only two years ago .\n",

This phone reminds me of all that stuff that made me love android as a good solid OS without having bloat ware and the lack of future proofing . It ’ s a beautiful display for 60 hertz , one hand use is really great and the build reminds me of the Nexus 5 . The camera was a pressing surprise given that I think it ’ s the same sensor that was on my 2 .

I used 120HZ refresh rate all the time , but quite honestly I don ' t see a great difference between them . Honestly , I would really hope this phone to have a bigger screen . The specs could be identical since I don ' t really need that many gimmicks . At this price , I will definitely recommend this phone to anyone .\n",

Pros : - Beautiful , bright , OLED screen that screams of a value point much much higher that where it currently sits . - Powerful camera features , especially Night Sight from its big brothers , that works fantastically in all sorts of difficult lighting conditions . - Good battery life , easily serviceable for a full day because of the efficient processor . - Great feeling and looking build ( not sure what all the hype is about glass backs when plastic feels this good ) - Wonderful haptic feedback and full - sounding loudspeaker - Headphone jack is back ! - Rear fingerprint sensor that serves as notification pull - down - Wonderful size and form factor . I have large hands and still feel like this footprint is perfect - Very capable and efficient 730G chipset ( less than 20 % slower than the 765G on Pixel 5 ) Cons - No wide angle or telephoto lens ( personally would have loved to see a 3x 12MP lens perhaps ? ) - No wireless charging or water resistance ( though with a C - to - C cable you ' d probably still be able to charge your buds ) Overall , this phone get ' s my highest recommendation .

( They are the worst manufacturer in terms of needlessly killing background apps ) . The camera is fantastic ! It ' s half because of the software and half because of the large pixels in the sensor . It ' s great in low light . The Night Sight mode is so much fun ! On a tripod or some other stable surface , astrophotography mode will engage in Night Sight mode that allows for amazing star photos . The real - time HDR adjustment and preview is really nice . Basically , you tap on some portion of the photo to choose what you want the primary exposure to lock onto ( like the bright part of a sunset ) then a slider appears that lets you control the fill light . It ' s wonderful ! It got the Android 11 update immediately after I bought it , so that ' s cool . Lots of nice little updates in that . The default gesture navigation doesn ' t work well with 3rd party launchers . ( I use Nova Launcher ) . When I swipe up to go to the home screen , I can ' t tap any icons for 1 second . They don ' t respond . It ' s weird . But with the old school 3 - button nav it works fine . Swiping up from the bottom also appears to choose the 3rd party launcher and if it were an app , then it reopens it . That might be part of that problem . Neither of these things happen with the default launcher , but that launcher wastes so much space on the clock and the search bar , so I don ' t like it . The CPU / GPU is plenty fast for me . I don ' t play much mobile gaming . Just some board games sometimes . The AI in Waterdeep takes it ' s turns quite a bit faster than on my old OnePlus 3T , so that ' s nice . Headphone jack and fingerprint reader are a huge plus for me . You get a lot of phone for the price !\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1651: Honestly , I ' m a bit disappointed with this phone , though I really wanted to like it . I made my purchase directly through Google , not Amazon , but I really felt like saying something about the 4a . Every phone has features that you like or dislike and the dislikes with this phone have been a real turn - off . I bought the 4a as a replacement for a ASUS Zenfone 3 Max , which I really loved until the camera started taking mushy photos . In - fact , that ' s the main reason I replaced the Zenfone , which was otherwise functioning flawlessly . For about two and a half years , the Zenfone actually took really great photos . The 64 megapixel mode could capture clear signs on a building from half a mile away . One day , it just started taking bad pics . So when I heard of all of the hype behind the Pixel 4a and the fantastic photographic abilities , I was really excited . I ' m not one to spend a massive amount on a phone , so the idea of getting a \" flagship class \" camera at an affordable price really got my attention . I waited about a month to receive the phone . I liked the lack of bloatware . I immediately changed the swiping features to the old fashioned buttons at the bottom of the screen . Just couldn ' t get the hang of the gestures . I find the height of the screen just right . I ' ve come to hate the narrow width , which make me feel like I ' m breaking my thumbs when I key . Mind you , I don ' t have large hands , but for me personally , it beats the heck out of my thumbs to key with the 4a . I like the screen overall . The blacks are deep . The screen is a little too cool for me , so I actually prefer to use the phone in night mode and switch to normal when I ' m talking pics . HOWEVER , there are often occasions when the screen stutters when scrolling through web pages . It ' s not on every page , but I will invariably see stuttering on multiple webpages over the course of the day . I have never seen this behavior in my old Zenphone . . . ever . Another annoyance is the frequency with which my 4a refuses to load a webpage . Maybe a few times a day , I ' ll run a search for something and the phone will freeze while opening the webpage . The progress meter will just hang at about 10 % and the page won ' t open . Maybe 30 seconds later , eureka , it opens . Given none of our other phones in the family do this , I don ' t believe it ' s a WiFi thing . It must be buggy software . One thing that really irritates me . . . Let me explain . Let ' s say I open the Google app and search for ' Moon Landing ' . I find an interesting article that mentions Neil Armstrong . I copy Neil Armstrong , open another Google windows and search for him . When I want to go back to the Moon Landing article , which I minimized to search for Neil , well . . . it ' s gone ! If you try to open the Google app more than once , the original window will disappear in favor of the new window . This NEVER happened on my Zenfone . I could open Google a dozen times and search many different topics . If I minimized a window , I could always return to it . Why the Pixel 4a doesn ' t work that way is baffling . In - fact , I sat the two phones side by side and tried this . Every time , the Pixel would close the minimized Google window . Yet the Zenfone gave me many Google tabs to work with . For me personally , this is the worst feature ( or non - feature ) of the 4a . The stereo speakers sound quite nice . No real complaints there . Battery life . It ' s really so - so . I ' m not exactly a power user . I keep the screen brightness in the lower third of the scale . I tend to scroll through the news in the morning , watch a few news clips and maybe some YouTube and I find myself recharging at about mid - day if I want to make it to the evening . Google should really have given the 4a a larger battery . I imagine , given how batteries degrade over time , that in a year or so , this battery will have pretty sad life . So finally , the camera . . . Portraits are something to behold . I ' ve been into photography for a long time now and I ' ve got to say that the 4a is one of those cameras that captures the \" soul \" of the subject - - a real old - fashioned Kodachrome feel . Night mode is decent overall , though it tends to capture weird pixelated halos around store signs that are quite distracting and that I never witnessed in my Zenfone ' s better days . Aside from the above , the 4a takes a nosedive on most other photos . If you ' re a pixel peeper , you ' re not going to be happy . Let ' s imagine a daylight photo taken of a row of building 50 meters away . Upon initial inspection the photo will look pretty good . Colors are vivid and accurate . Zoom in on a photo and the pics become very pixelated and \" artifacty \" . Distinct lines are broken and edgy . Actually , I ' d call them mushy , not unlike my sick Zenfone . Unfortunately , I take a lot of landscape photos and there are times when computational photography can ' t make up for raw megapixel count . Frankly , in it ' s prime , my old Zenfone would have trounced all over the 4a in landscape photography - - and by a wide margin . No kidding . It ' s really up to you what you do . I know a lot of folks are happy with the 4a . With respect to photography , if you do almost entirely portraits , you should be happy . I would definitely pick something else of I had it to do again . I ' m not making a recommendation , just giving my opinion . I ' d certainly go for something with a bigger battery and a better sensor for landscape photography . Best wishes !\n",

Is the battery super high capacity ? No again , but I never need to charge it more than once per day , and at the end of the day I still have 20 hours of battery left . Maybe if you shoot a lot of video this phone wouldn ' t hold out long , but for my very average usage it ' s fine . Does it have a fancy glass or metal case ? No , but most people with fancy looking phones put a case on them anyway . Or they crack . Does it have a punch hole camera ? Yes , and here ' s my only major gripe . I never use the selfie camera , and Netflix seems to be the only major streaming app that can stretch to full screen . All of the other apps I have ( Hulu , HBO Max , Prime Video ) slam the video to the right hand side which will round off the corners of 16 : 9 video . The punch hole itself doesn ' t even bother me anymore . I just want full screen video in my streaming apps , and it ' s not even Google ' s fault on this one . The verdict is that the Pixel 4a is a solid budget smartphone . It gets regular security updates , is probably getting Android 12 , doesn ' t have a terrible app launcher , and isn ' t going to crack like my glass back Motorola X4 .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1662: The last year or so has been a concern for me because I was afraid the mid - range phone I bought three years ago would break . The new offerings have not been compelling , mainly offering better cameras but not significantly stronger processing and smaller manufacturing processes ( e . g . 7nm ) . That has changed just in the past few months and even days as there are now at least three compelling mid - range phones . I bought the Pixel 4a because it was : ( 1 ) One of the least expensive ; ( 2 ) Offers one of the best OS upgrade / update policies ; and ( 3 ) Is not made in China or by a Chinese firm - - pick your reason not to like China right now - - there are at least four . There are things I wish it had , primarily microSD and a SD 765G processor , but the 730 is plenty fast . IMHO , we ' re well past the stage where most people have any real need for flagship processors ( gamers excluded ) I ' ll upgrade my wife ' s phone to 5G later , we would mainly need that for tethering , and we don ' t both need it . It will probably be the 5G version of the Pixel 4a or the Samsung 51 . The packaging is fairly basic , containing the phone , a 120 volt charging block , USB - C cable and a sim tool . Also , it has a very useful adaptor from the large plug USB to USB - C . That is given to help connect to your old phone , but is also useful for Yubi security keys . The phone came roughly 60 % charged and didn ' t require any security updates that I noticed , having Android 10 installed with security updates current to within 15 days ( which makes me think I missed a security update being installed ) . As to the phone , it ' s roughly the same size as what I ' m used to coming from a Moto 5G Plus , but it is slightly narrower . Overall I like the change . I have not noticed any lag , and overall the phone seems very responsive , as it should coming from a phone that is over three years old in design . I wasn ' t sure I ' d like the fingerprint scanner on the back , but that has been fine . Setting up was a bit more difficult in that the automatic transfer process the phone tries to start apparently did not work at all , or maybe I ' m just not patient enough . My old phone said \" preparing \" for over 20 minutes without any indication of progress on either phone . Setting up the old fashioned way was very quick , with my roughly 150 apps installing quickly . The only problem I ' ve had is related to my Google Suite Account , which in the newer version of Android becomes a work account . That keeps me from signing into Google maps with that account , which I ' m still trying to work around . If you don ' t have a paid Google Suite Account this shouldn ' t be an issue . I also had to change a few of the default settings , but surprisingly few . I turned off a few things to save battery life , such as monitoring for songs in the background , and turned on the virtual navigation keys at the bottom of the screen , which I prefer to their gestures system . Too early to say anything about battery life because my use of the phone has been far from normal . I ' ll report back if it can ' t get through a normal day with at least 25 % of battery left .\n",

Sólo le falta versatilidad , en calidad visual y detalle de lo MEJOR que hay en el mercado . En video es bueno , pero se podría haber mejorado un poco más ( apple sigue siendo superior en esto ) . - Tamaño 10 / 10 . Muy ergonómico para el día a día , fácilmente se puede ocupar con una sola mano , liviano . - Software 8 . 5 / 10 . Android de Google va muy fluido en este dispositivo , a pesar de que el chip 730G es inferior a otros ( 765G ) . Puntos positivos , los 3 años de actualizaciones , Google assistant y que no tiene app ' s basura como MIUI y Samsung . Sin embargo android 11 hay que mejorarlo un poco más , lo cuál es entendible ya que se ha actualizado recientemente . - Batería 7 / 10 . Para mi uno de los puntos más \" flojos \" . Google hizo una buena optimización con el consumo de la batería y se debe destacar , fácilmente se puede llegar a un día de uso ( en cuarentena he ocupado bastante el consumo multimedia , YT , instagram ) . Sin embargo , no sé cómo se comportará en un año más , razón por la cuál hubiera agradecido tener una batería de al menos 3400 mA o más . - Diseño y Construcción 7 / 10 . Destacar que el teléfono en mano se ve mucho mejor que en fotos , o entrega una sensación un poco más premium de lo que realmente esperaba . El acabado en plástico me da cierta sensación de fragilidad si el teléfono se llegara a caer y temo por la pantalla ( espero estar equivocado ) . Por último , visualmente se debe mejorar , sigue siendo un teléfono poco atractivo para la mayoría de usuarios . Creo que si Google mejorara sus diseños , podrían atraer a muchos más consumidores . - Precio 10 / 10 . A pesar del costo de envío e importación , sigue siendo mejor alternativa que los modelos que se venden en mi país ( Huawei , Samsung , Xiaomi , Motorola , etc . ) por el mismo precio .\n",

My old phone was slow and froze frequently within the first few months of having it , but the Pixel 4a has none of those problems ! The camera is amazing , and has a lot of great settings and options . I will attach a regular picture and a portrait mode picture to show the clarity and great quality . The camera is also quickly accessable by double tapping the lock button on the side of the phone . I noticed that Google Duo has a share screen feature that is available on the Pixel 4a , but not a lot of other phones , and I enjoy having that option . The fingerprint reader works great . The battery lasts a very long time . I use my phone very frequently and usually charge it to 70 or 80 % to preserve battery life . Even with all the usage , I usually only have to charge it once a day . It would definitely take a while to die with a full charge so no worries there . The thing I came across the most while researching the phone prior to purchasing was \" it ' s a great budget phone \" and I 100 % agree . I ' m no tech expert , but as a regular user , I can say this is the best phone I have ever had . In comparison with the Pixel 4 ( which I do not have ) , the Pixel 4a does have a headphone jack , but does not have wireless charging or the squeeze feature , and is not water - resistant . I have the phone in \" Just Black \" and it is very nice and sleek with a white lock button .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1676: You ’ d think only $ 800 + smartphones are worth it . Then something like the Google Pixel 4a comes along and makes you reconsider . It ’ s not so much because you ’ re getting more overall than on a pricier smartphone , but rather it ’ s the fact that you get a lot for the price of $ 350 that makes this phone stand out from the pack . The Pixel 4a will tempt even users of high end smartphones to consider the minimalistic , but punchy , approach of Google with this device . It delivers in what matters and it cuts corners where it doesn ’ t , making us feel uncomfortable about the amounts of money we spend on flagship smartphones . The first thing that will make an impression is the size of the phone . The Pixel 4a is a small phone for 2020 . You can handle it with one hand , which says a lot . But even though it ’ s small , it still provides 5 . 8 inches of screen real estate , mostly due to the very thin bezels and the punch - hole camera . The body is made of plastic and it ’ s in a matte black finish . This choice of materials makes the 4a very light , especially when I compare it to my daily iPhone X which feels super heavy with its glass surfaces . Even though beauty is in the eye of the beholder , I did find the back side design a bit dull , lacking any elements that would make it stand out from the crowd . But this is to be expected at this price range . On the back , you ’ ll find the camera - flash array in the upper left corner , and a fingerprint sensor centrally located . The latter sinks in the back panel , making it easy to find it without looking . On the left side of the phone you ’ ll find the SIM card tray , and on the right side there are the power and volume buttons . Google made the power button white , which is an interesting choice of color . The top includes a headphones jack ( yay ) and the bottom provides the USB - C charging port and two speaker holes . The screen is one of the impressive points . Google equipped the Pixel 4a with a wonderful 5 . 8 inches Full HD + OLED screen , with a density of 443 ppi and an aspect ratio of 19 . 5 : 9 . The screen is very bright and with nice and accurate colors . The responsiveness of swiping and gestures is great , and I didn ’ t notice any lag while operating the phone . It ’ s amazing how good this screen is , especially if you think about the price of this device . On the top left corner you ’ ll find the punch - hole front camera , used for front facing video and selfies . This is a great move by Google to maximize screen area and minimize the bezels around it . It also contributes in the compactness of the device overall , which could be a decisive factor for many potential buyers . What I love about this device is that is provides a decently large screen ( 5 . 8 inches ) at a size that can be operated with one hand and is also very lightweight ( due to the use of plastics instead of the more premium aluminum or glass ) . Compared to my daily iPhone X , this phone feels smaller and lighter even though the X has the same screen size . Impressive . Unlocking the phone is quite easy ; grab the phone and slide your index finger over the fingerprint sensor . I will admit though , I ’ m too used to Apple ’ s facial recognition and I ’ m still trying to get used to this . Also , I wish Google had placed the fingerprint sensor slightly higher . My index finger keeps going higher and then lower , and also my car mount tends to cover the fingerprint sensor unless I slide the device higher when mounting it . But these are no dealbreakers by any means , especially if you think about the price tag . Things regarding performance are simple . Qualcomm ’ s Snapdragon 730G isn ’ t the sharpest processor out there , but Google had no other option for a device priced at $ 350 . Regardless , the 2 . 2GHz clocked CPU is perfect for average daily use and moderate power consumption . Sure , it won ’ t impress in gaming , but it will deliver competently in everything else . The 6GB of RAM memory help the Pixel 4a maintain consistency throughout its performance . 4GB have been proven to not be enough for modern smartphones and thankfully Google packed 6GB in the 4a . That , combined with the 128GB of storage space , will allow users to download and install multiple apps without worrying about any shortcomings . Battery autonomy is great too . With 3140 milliamps per hour , and a low powered CPU , you will most probably get more than 1 . 5 days of operation time before you have to recharge ( provided that the average screen time is around a modest 2 - 2 . 5 hours / day ) . The Google Pixel 4a is equipped with a 12 MP rear camera using the IMX363 sensor , with Optical & Electronic Image Stabilization ( OIS + EIS ) . The aperture is f / 1 . 7 and the field of view is 77 degrees . It can shoot 4K videos at 30fps or 1080p video at 60 fps . The front facing camera has an 8 MP sensor , an f / 2 . 0 aperture and an 88 degrees field of view . The 4a shoots great pictures with nice colors and good dynamic ranges . The contrast is at a good level as well . Overall the pictures look amazing for a $ 350 device . I have attached some images that show the same picture shot with the Google Pixel 4a , the iPhone X and the iPhone XR . I am really happy with how the pictures from the 4a turned out . The Pixel 4a of this article is rocking the Android 10 , June 2020 build . As all Google Android phones , it has a simple but very smooth and to the point GUI . Features such as Google Assistant and Call Screening are present in the 4a , as well as advanced AI functionalities that improve several aspects of the phone ( for example , AI image processing of the pictures taken by the rear camera ) . But maybe the most important software “ feature ” of a Pixel phone is the guaranteed support for at least three years . That means that the Pixel 4a will be receiving Android updates at least until 2023 . Overall the Google Pixel 4a is an amazing mid - level smartphone . It offers plenty of features and functionalities at the very reasonable price of $ 350 dollars . It excels in many areas , and it manages to mask the few deficiencies it has . The 4a is a very affordable way to experience the pure Android world with Google ’ s great software support . If you are in the market for an affordable but great Android smartphone , look no more .\n",

The \u001b[32m<speed:Positive Confidence:0.9478>\u001b[0m of this phone is unlike any other at products at this pricing . Just don ' t expect this to be a high end gaming device or a and hd \u001b[31m<video:Negative Confidence:0.8226>\u001b[0m recorder with high frame rate . Otherwise , If you need a taste of the greatest smart phone experience and not having much on your budget and no need of crazy all the expensive unwanted features , this phone is a must .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1704: Great phone if you just want the basics to do everyday tasks ( e - mail , social media , selfies , take pictures of random stuff , Youtube , streaming video , online shopping , etc ) without the bells and whistles . $ 350 is an excellent price for what it can do especially if you ' re on a budget . Unlike a premium $ 800 + phone it does NOT have 1 . Water , Dust Resistance . Have that bag of rice handy just in case , and don ' t kick it around constantly in dry dirt / sand 2 . Active Edge . Unlike the past few pixel phones , cannot squeeze phone for Google Assistant 3 . Facial recognition . Has a very responsive fingerprint reader on back . 4 . 4K screen . Has 1080p OLED display , 60hz refresh . If your eyes are used to 4k screens with high refresh rate then this may feel like a downgrade , if not , it ' s manageable . Able to multi - task without any lag ( unless your eyes are trained to do so ) 5 . Wireless charging . Wired fast charging only . 6 . Aluminum or glass body : Phone exterior has a uni - body plastic design . Sturdy and fingerprint resistant 7 . Support 5G . There is a 5g model coming soon ( as of this review ) - - What it does have / list of features : Excellent camera : Single camera front and back ( 12MP ) . No wide angle . excellent post processing software . One of the best cameras on the market ( as of this review ) even when compared to $ 1000 + phones especially in astro photography . Front camera is a whole punch design instead of integrated into a bezel . Great Battery life : 10 hour screen on time . Can last 1 to 1 . 5 days depending on usage It does have headphone jack for those who still use wired headphones Stereo speakers are basic . Able to hear others through speaker phone . Decent bass if you want to listen to music without headphones 128gb storage E - sim option . No need for physical sim if you don ' t want to use it Has live Caption mode ( basically subtitles for your phone for media and phone calls ) , and Now Playing ( tells you what music is playing without going into an app ) Has 3 year software and security updates .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1709: I bought this to replace an ailing LG6 . I was most impressed with the \u001b[32m<setup:Positive Confidence:0.9979>\u001b[0m . I did it all in the car , riding as a passenger . You just connect the old phone and the new one with a cable , switch over the SIM card , and start the transfer . It installs the phone with the new SIM card , no \u001b[32m<waiting:Positive Confidence:0.9239>\u001b[0m at Verizon to do it and then paying them for the non - service . It transfers contacts , photos , and other content . All the apps are setup for transfer , but it waits until you have WiFi to start the process . Non - sensitive ones came over with passwords transferred , too . Sensitive ones , like bank card , mobile banking , and other security - sensitive apps required you to sign on again . Swiping instead of 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen finally had the best of me , but there is an option to install the traditional 3 - button controls , and it works like a charm .

One * really * nice feature of this phone is that it is dual - SIM capable ; you can have both a virtual and a physical SIM . If , like me , you carry a phone for work and a personal phone , you can consolidate down to one device and choose which carrier you use for your outgoing phone calls , and data , while being able to text and call from either number .

It ' s unobtrusive and way better than the notch or iPhone SE 2020 bezels if you want to stream content . The night mode is exceptional , and the photo quality is excellent . The only caveat is that it uses an old photo sensor so when you zoom in , there is a bit of noise . This is just nitpicking but the camera is perfect for only $ 350 . Picture quality retains much of the color as well . The phone is also relatively snappy with zero lag . Not as fast as the SE ' s A13 but it very well gets the job done . Gaming is also fine on this phone . You should probably play medium to low graphics with this mid - range processor . I tested Asphalt 9 and WOT Blitz , and these games run very smoothly on this phone . I experienced no lags and stutters . If you want high frame rates at the highest settings , you should look elsewhere . Now onto battery life . This phone charges around an hour and 15 mins with its supplied 18 - watt charger . For me , the phone barely lasted a day , but since I ' m at home all day , I don ' t think that my usage is an accurate representation of the general public . Most people would be FINE with 1 charge / day . No complaints here . Now here ' s the kicker : you get unlimited high - quality photo storage on Google photos + 128 GB of internal memory .

No overlayed brand bloat software , no brand promoted apps you can ' t get rid of , no third party branded internet browser you can ' t uninstall , and the pure Android runs really smooth and fast . You can add Firefox , Opera , or any browser you wish . Fits well in one hand for single - handed use while still fitting in a pocket . There ' s probably nothing better in the price range if you need CDMA and GSM ability in one phone . I transferred all settings , contacts , messages and phone number with the provided cable and was able to use my old sim with no issues . No hassle . I don ' t understand why this is often compared to flagship phones in the $ 600 up range - it ' s not . Google makes others beside the Pixel 4a if you need 5G or some trendy features . If you are upgrading from a cheaper , outdated OS LG , Samsung , Motorola phone this is a clear winner . Two or three times the ram and most likely double the storage of your old phone . It does have a plastic back , but it ' s very sturdy without flex and better made than my LG and previous Samsung that will never offer system updates . . The Pixel 4a came with Android 10 and has already updated to 11 . Display is good , even in sunlight where cheap phones may not be . The speakers do not rival $ 800 phones , but they are very good sounding compared to $ 100 - 250 phones ; much better than the rear firing speakers I was used too . Bluetooth and wireless signal and sound quality are strong as well , with better speed on wireless . . The single lens camera is great for low light and sharp images in . raw or standard . jpeg like most folks use - far superior color , sharpness , and exposure than other phones also rated at 12 MP - but note that you can ' t adjust the shutter speed or f stop like a S20FE or S10 - but I really don ' t need three lenses , I have a dslr for that . There ' s an 8mp front camera that performs well too . There ' s no SD card slot , and I initially thought that was a minus since I use a 64GB SD for music .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1751: Picked up my Pixel 4a through Visible a couple of days ago . So far , this is an excellent phone and exactly what I needed . I read a lot of reviews here and elsewhere , so I ' ll address my trepidations were buying the Pixel 4a . My phone before the 4a was a Pixel 2 . I was , overall , happy with this phone although it was clearly dated . Build quality and plastics Some reviews suggested that the phone felt like a toy . It ' s made out of plastic and does lack that certain feel of glass or metal ( I prefer metal , like the Pixel 2 , myself ) , it ' s well put together and feels good in the hands . I don ' t think it feels like a toy or cheap although it doesn ' t feel like a flagship phone , and that ' s fine because the 4a is clearly a midrange feel . I personally prefer plastic to glass as it seems more sturdy . There ' s no flex or anything else , and the phone feels very solid . Form factor One of the biggest selling points of the 4a is its compact form factor . I hate large phones . Phone sizes have creeped up over the years and before getting my Pixel 2 renewed on Amazon I was using a Nokia phone that was considerably bigger . It never felt comfortable in the hand . The Pixel 4a might , if anything , feel a bit too small but maybe that ' s because my P2 was slightly bigger . Once I slipped a cover on ( the X - level Google Pixel 4a Case Slim Fit ) it felt perfect . I usually avoid covers because the phones feel too bulky afterward but that ' s not the case with the 4a . Screen Love the screen . Some people may not like the hole punch for the camera but it doesn ' t bother me . I know a lot of Android phones are moving up from 60hz to 90 or 120 hz ( higher hz creates smoother scrolling and movement ) . The 4a sticks with 60hz and I think that ' s fine . Apple also sticks with 60z and for a good reason : it ' s better on battery life . Most TVs are still 60hz as well , I don ' t think most people will be bothered by 60hz unless coming from a higher hz phone . Colors are great , the resolution means you don ' t see pixels . While some reviews complained about brightness , I find the 4a is plenty bright . The screen is pretty reflective , however . Swiping and touch input registers well in my experience . The screen does gather fingerprints quicker than I ' d like . Battery Life I was worried about battery life but so far the 4a doesn ' t struggle with moderate usage and lasts all day easily . Most importantly , Google seems to really have optimized standby power usage . If I leave my 4a off the charge and don ' t use it for 8 hours ( tested while sleeping ) I only lose about 2 percent . If I left my P2 off the charger , it ' d still drain pretty quickly and I ' d come back with like half the battery left ( in fairness , the battery is pretty old now ) . Internals The biggest downside to the P4a is probably the internals , but it ' s important to remember that this phone only costs $ 350 . The processor and ram offer for a good user experience , and while power users may need something more powerful , I doubt it ' ll affect me for at least 2 or 3 years . The 6gb ram ensures good multitasking . The battery is a bit small , but as noted above , battery life is solid if not excellent . There ' s no 5G , which is a big downside . The P4a 5G was too big for me so I skipped that . With my own usage , I doubt the lack of 5g will affect me much , but for future proofing and what not , I ' d definitely still rather have it . Fingerprint reader Snappy , accurate , and you can enable downswips to bring up notifications , which is really convenient . Some reviewers complained that the thumbprint reader was too shallow and hard to find . I disagree , after a few minutes of usage , I could find it every time quickly . Now I have a cover on so the thumbprint reader is much deeper . Charging Charges pretty quickly but other companies are installing faster charging in their phone . The P4a using 18w charging , I know some phone companies are using 30w ( not much faster in real life ) and 65w charging ( substantially faster ) . It ' d be nice to have faster charging . No wireless charging either , which would be a nice added feature . But again , this is a $ 350 phone . Android I like Pixel phones because they offer the best android experience IMO . That ' s the same here . I wish Google offered 4 years of support ( like apple ) instead of 3 but either way it ' s a great experience . Conclusion I am a moderate user in regards to phones , I play simple games , check email , message people , etc . For my uses , the Pixel 4a is a close to perfect phone , and while there are some shortcomings , I just remind myself that this is a $ 350 phone .\n",

I enjoy how easily it slipped into my pocket , or how easily it is to use with single hand . I ' ve had zero performance issues so far . I was surprised there was no sort of slowdown or sluggishness at all . I ' ve owned several android phones and had the Pixel 4a for a while . It ’ s performed pretty much flawlessly , both the software and the hardware . I haven ’ t been easy on trying to push the 4a to its limit . It works so well and smooth on its system . The best part is when I am wearing the face mask , it is fantastic to have a fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone . The battery life of this new 4a has been good enough . I was able to get through a full day using , but just barely . If it is used heavily like watching youtube / Netflix / playing games for a long time , I think the backup power will be required . I am a Google fan so I installed a lot of smart devices in my house . The google assistant connects my Nest ring camera , Nest AC control , Google home , switches . If you need to set reminders , open apps , send messages , adjust the settings , of control your smart home , instead of scrolling and clicking , all can be set up through voice control on google assistant . And I was very surprised by the quality of the photos my 4a taked . I do love all cam features ! And the night mode feature ! ! I am in love with it as you dont need to be professional to take amazing night and light shots . I believe that the phones at the same price are not comparable to it . The speakers are with high quality and bass ! Transcribe feature works good . Screen resolution is beautiful as well . I am very grateful that Pixel 4a uses the classic 3 . 5MM headphone jack . You know that all good headphones use 3 . 5mm . Now I can use my headphone without a conncter . Overall , it ’ s a great phone ! I would highly recommend it . I think the 4a is worth for its price .\n",

And Pixel 4a meets that need . Since there are already excellent reviews in YouTube and Amazon , I will just add my personal experience with the phone . Pixel 4a fits nicely in my hand now . I can use the phone with one hand without fumbling it . My previous phone Moto G7 while great still was a little big for my hands . I do not support iPhone ecosystem , so I was looking for Android . My wife ' s phone Pixel 3a was great in my hands so I thought I would check out Pixel 4a and it has bigger screen yet smaller than 3a ! So I grabbed it and using it for a month , I am really satisfied . Size and weight are perfect and the performance is more than I need ( I am not a gamer , so I don ' t need a powerful processor ) . The screen is OLED and is clearly better than IPS LCD screens . The colors are just more rich and pop out than IPS LCD . Battery lasts more than 1 full day ( my average screen time is between 3 - 4 hours ) . And the camera ! Wow . . . It is really good . I ' ve heard it was good , but actually seeing it - I was really impressed . The ONLY thing I wish Pixel 4a had was : Water and dust proof feature ( IP 68 ) . But for $ 350 , this phone is amazing . And you also get 3 year software update guarantee . So if you are not looking for a premium phone , but something small yet powerful and takes great pictures , then Pixel 4a is an excellent choice !

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1769: I originally had a Pixel 3a for a year but decided to sell it in May 2020 to try something else . I went to a Xiaomi Note 9 Pro , Samsung S20 FE , Realme 6 Pro , Samsung S20 FE again , and now the Pixel 4a . I could have avoided all of those phones if I just stuck with Pixel . The instant security and OS updates , compact form factor , ease of flashing custom ROMs and reverting back to stock with Google ' s online tool , excellent battery life , and bloat free , fast software experience are what make Pixel the best . I commonly get 6 . 5hrs screen on time with auto brightness and light theme on . Although I really enjoyed the Xiaomi and Realme , they do not support VoLTE and WiFi calling in the US with US carriers . Samsung even though they have the best hardware , OneUI is by far my least favorite Android skin . I was GLAD to lose the superior screen , speakers , 5G , 120Hz , and WiFi 6 on the S20 FE to go to the lesser Pixel because the software experience is just that much faster and better . I forgot how much faster and more accurate physical fingerprint readers were compared to the in screen ones . Pixel 4a is definitely the phone you should go for . In my experience , 5G in my area is really not better , if not worse than 4G LTE especially since the 5G in my area is low band non stand alone . The 5G speeds were the same as 4G and I experienced higher latency in certain areas . For this reason I ' d choose the 4a over the 4a 5G unless you want the bigger screen . The 4a should have been $ 299 to compete more with the OnePlus Nord N10 but the extra $ 50 is well worth it for the longer software support Pixel provides . Overall an excellent phone and I HIGHLY recommend it after having used most major phone brands within a short period of time .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1777: I ' m coming from a samsung android note 9 . Loved my note 9 but turns out I ' m not that good with big bulky all glass expensive phones . . . Who woulda thought . . . My whole back of my note 9 phone was shattered and the screen was cracked and I had an otterbox on it the entire time I had the thing . Long story short I bought the phone out after 2 years to switch services and when I went to switch they took my case off to switch sim cards and it was a shattered mess which I was highly disappointed about because I thought it was in good shape ! . I could have gotten it fixed for around $ 400 or I could get a different phone . I didn ' t want nothing hella expensive I ' m tired of having to pay extra for phone payments and then just breaking them because obviously I ' m just not good with phones ! I wanted something budget friendly with a good quality camera but still similar to androids system . I ' ve been team android forever now I just really don ' t care for their picture quality though , I have tried iphone out as well I had the iphone x and it just wasn ' t for me , however I did love the picture quality , so since I ' ve tried both ios and android and have certain things I like and disliked for both of them I figured it was time to give pixels a try ! Pros : This phone is cute , little , and light weight phone , but like not so little that the screens no good . The screen to phone ratio is super nice and makes the phone feel smaller with a good sized screen . Which is what I wanted I was over having huge , heavy bulky phones , I have little hands and I constantly was dropping my bigger phones . . . Picture quality is awesome ! It def beats android and I think it might even beat iphones ! Easy set up with transferring from my old phone to this one . The backs plastic ! Which that was what I was looking for ! People complain that \" oh its so boring looking with the plain black plastic back \" . . . I don ' t get it , so youd rather have a pretty glass back that you end up covering with a bulky case . . . Cause that makes so much sense . . . I like how you can either have the navigation buttons or you can use the swipe controls . I like this so your not stuck with one or the other . battery lifes pretty good the charge seems to last me as long as my note 9 did . It def seems very durable . I do have a screen protector along with a case on this phone , not even a good case or screen protector just something cheap I grabbed . I ' ve dropped the phone a few times now and no have had no issues ! Volume is also pretty good Cons : My biggest pet peeves with this phone isssss I hate the way screen shots are on this phone ! Okay so the power button and the volume down button is how you take screen shots , which is normal for screen shots but on this phone the volume buttons and the power button are on the same side which makes it awkward to do and then sometimes when doing it the volume bar will pop up and turn everything all the way down and the bar just stays there which is annoying . . . . I don ' t like how there ' s not as much customization as androids would have , such as changing the themes and stuff which sorta disappoints me . Conclusion : All in all , the pixel 4a really is not a bad budget phone for people like me that are just to rough for these high end all glass , thousand dollar phones . . . I would eventually like to get one of the nicer pixels this one was mostly to try it out and see if I even like them before getting one of the more expensive ones later down the road . Nice thing about pixels even there higher end phones such as the pixel 5 arent robbing you like some of these dang androids and iphones are ! If your looking for a nice budget phone you won ' t go wrong getting this one . Would recommend !\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1782: [ May 7 , 2021 thoughts on Pixel 4a , ordered November 8 , 2020 and used daily ever since ] PROS : Form factor and weight - This is the best marriage I have found . Fantastic screen real estate , sensible ( ideal ? ) resolution , and just terrific dimensions for me . This thing is light weight for its size , and I love that more than I can possibly express . Hand fatigue has been all but completely eliminated . Give me plastics , baby ! I have no desire for metals that don ' t add to functionality ( and apparently , from something I saw on YouTube , this phone is insanely rugged , even with a plastic shell ) . Glass is always heavier and less durable than other materials choices , and it ' s just altogether not well suited for the backside of a mobile handset , IMO . I think Apple charges $ 550 to replace the back glass on most modern iPhones . This Pixel 4a is the total package and stickers for $ 200 less than the price of Apple ' s back glass repair . Price : Performance - While I can ' t compare this phone to another of its kind with a higher performing Qualcomm , I am never wanting for speed . This phone has been wonderfully fluid and performant for my day - to - day needs . The lean Android experience on the Pixel line really lets its mid - range Qualcomm shine . I most recently carried both an iPhone 7 Plus and 2020 SE , and both proved plenty fast for anything I do ; this 4a is no exception . Background app refreshes seem to be on par with what I had using 3GB iPhones . No real surprises . My day - to - day habits seem mostly unaffected by any background app refreshes I ' ve noticed . I think the 6GB of memory strikes a good balance for the 4a . I don ' t game . Well , I play some chess now and again , including occasional analysis using very demanding engines ( Stockfish , etc ) , but in general I can ' t comment on gaming performance . Battery - Battery life and charging time have been lovely . I seldom charge to 100 - percent , instead I prefer to just give little 5 - to 15 - minute charges periodically during the day , while keeping the battery in the 30 - to 70 - percent range where possible . This thing charges way , way faster than my older 7 Plus and 2020 SE iPhones and overall battery life is likely comparable or better from what I can gather ( very unscientifically ) . I leave it to the readers to determine how important battery life is and do some research of their own . Camera - It ' s so good it doesn ' t even make sense . Shooting stills , the 4a smashes my old iPhone 7 Plus my a wide margin and the 2020 SE couldn ' t hold a candle either . I think that ' s being objective . I ' ve had quite a bit of low - level , professional photography training at University level and time behind the lens of DSLRs , and I ' m quite astonishing that I can get such quality images from the 4a . The software image processing is pure magic . I have kids , and they ' re the important subjects for me . I ' d guessed the 4a might struggle with motion , particularly in lower light , which would have been a deal - breaker for me , but this thing takes \" keepers \" practically every single time . Glorious . Most already know how well Pixel phones shoot non - moving subjects , so I won ' t carry on about that . It ' s an exciting camera experience . Concerning video , the 1080p 30 - and 60 - frame shooting has not disappointed either , and the image stabilization is truly excellent . I don ' t mess with 4k on phones ( yet ) , so no comment there . I don ' t take selfies , so I won ' t comment on the front - facing camera either . Android - The gesture navigation is fantastic , particularly the ability to go back by swiping in from either the left - or right - hand side of the display . Massively convenient and easy on the hands . Updates / security patches are crucial for me , and with a Pixel , scorching fast updates are what you get , and support duration bests most Android - based OEMs . Fingerprint recognition - Works as well and as fast as any I ' ve experienced . Thought the rear placement would bug me . It absolutely does not . Rear placement is probably my preference now . Well executed . I like . CONS : Audio volume / intensity - The 4a just doesn ' t get as loud as some other modern handsets . It ' s tricky to listen to a podcast or whatever when I ' m doing dishes , for example . That said , the audio quality is perfectly satisfactory , to me . Google Search - There ' s a Google search bar installed by default on the home screen . I leave mine there and find it useful . When tapped , you ' re presented with the ability to \" search apps , web , and more . . . \" ( much like the search on iOS when you pull down from the top ) . Google / Android learns over time , so that eventually it can quickly present you with what you ' re most likely to want . Works great , more often than not . But the problem for me is that it ' s inconsistent with regards to displaying apps . It must be that about 20 - percent of the time it doesn ' t display apps , so I ' m forced to swipe up from the bottom of the display to close the interface , then tap the Google search bar again before it populates apps in the query . I can ' t figure out what causes this for the life of me , and I ' ve owned an IT MSP for years , so this ain ' t my first rodeo with tech devices ! Frustrating , but muscle memory makes this only a half - second affair to correct . Dependability - I ' ve long used the same MVNO for cell service , which I mention only because there exists a small possibility that it ' s of importance here : I ' ve found a few occasions where I can ' t place phone calls . To fix , for some reason , a reboot was required . I haven ' t had any issues in the past few months , but it ' s probably because I ' ve changed habits ; now , whenever there ' s an update to something low - level from Android ( not just a basic app update ) , I reboot the phone . An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure ? ? Anyway , I ' d have a \" need \" to reboot an iPhone maybe once every six months , outside of forced reboots from doing an iOS update . To have had to monthly ( or maybe even more frequently ) reboot this 4a in order to connect phone calls ( with no warning as to any trouble , unless I attempted to place a call and \" connect the dots \" ) is unfortunate . I don ' t like to have to think about mitigating critically buggy behavior by rebooting my phone from time to time . OLED - I ' m sensitive to flicker , so I basically hate OLED . My daily driver laptop is a ThinkPad T480s LARGELY because its 1080p IPS is flicker - free ( no PWM ) . This 4a gives me viewing fatigue after a relatively short while . On the 4a , unless you ' re at max brightness ( exactly 100 - percent ) , you can expect flicker in the ~ 122 to 255Hz range . That ' s too low for me . I would prefer an LCD , like the ones I had in my iPhone 7 Plus or 2020 SE . I could view those endlessly without fatigue - read books on them , you name it . But the industry does trend , and trend it does for the contrast ratio specs and inky blacks the kids rave about these days { rolls eyes } . Overall : This is probably the finest overall set of compromises I ' ve ever found in a cell phone , and I ' ve owned many of them since 1994 . I ' m highly satisfied with this handset , and I think very little could realistically be done today to improve upon the formula that is the Pixel 4a . Google has made a proper phone for adults . 9 / 10 DO recommend !\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1797: I should start by saying that up until I got the 4a I was a repeat offender of the iPhone . I was ready to cut the cord and get an Android and I thought I was going to love my Pixel for the sheer fact that it wasn ' t an iPhone . I ' ve had this since the week it came out ( about 2 months now ) and I regret this purchase immensely . The Pixel is really quirky , it stutters and lags with frustrating frequency when hitting buttons , often taking 2 - 3 seconds to \" think \" before executing the task you told it to ( even if it ' s just to close a window ) . Beyond that , I constantly find myself clicking on things I didn ’ t intend to . It seems as if when making a swipe , like scrolling through a website , it lags for a split - second mid - swipe and reads it as if you ’ re clicking on whatever is under your thumb at the moment of the lag . This is extremely frustrating when you find yourself constantly clicking on ads accidentally , or unintentionally “ liking ” your ex - girlfriends Instagram post as you scroll through your feed ( believe me , your excuse won ’ t be considered valid in the eyes of your current partner ) . It ' s interface is unintuitive , which I ' ll admit is partially a learning curve with the switch from Apple to Android . I hate to compare it to my iPhone 7 but that ' s all I know ; simple things like vibration patterns , red notification dots on app icons , etc . . . that are standard on an iPhone are not standard options on Android . I understand that people want the opportunity to fully \" customize \" their phone , but I don ' t want to have to learn how to program macros to make my phone ' s vibrate setting less annoying . The camera that everyone raves about . . . it ' s just okay . Certainly better than the iPhone 7 , but there ' s something artificial about it . Photo ' s make everything look almost like plastic and definitely not natural . Plus , the photo library is a maze of confusing folders . It requires navigating through 5 - 6 folders and sub - folders to attach a photo to a text from an SMS app . When you save a photo that is sent to you , you ' d think it would go into your photo library but no , it goes into it ' s own \" messages \" subfolder that you ' ll have to dig for later . I ' m sure there ' s a macro for that , but c ' mon . . . Call volume is bipolar at best ; it is either whisper - quiet even at full volume on speakerphone , or deafeningly loud . Even when my volume is at 0 ( not an exaggeration , literally 0 ) the volume of the call is sometimes eardrum - bursting . It ' s inconsistent , you never know what you ' re going to get , and I ' m almost scared to put the phone to my ear in fear of rupturing an ear - drum . The kicker for me , and the reason I finally decided to write this review , was earlier today when I started hearing voices come from my phone while it was not being used . Sitting at my desk doing work , with all apps closed , screen black , and faint voices start emitting from the phone like I was in a group - call . I don ’ t think I ’ m in need of a s é ance , but I also can ’ t explain that and it doesn ’ t make me feel comfortable about this phone in any way . I don ’ t want to sound entirely negative ; the plastic casing that most people complain about doesn ’ t bug me . It makes the phone lightweight and , lets be honest , do you know ANYONE who doesn ’ t use a phone case ? Even though the screen is mid - grade , it ’ s more than adequate and I ’ m glad that it has a headphone jack , even if it ’ s just for nostalgia and collecting pocket lint . At this point , I ' m considering my $ 400 a loss . I know I ’ m in the minority here ; all the “ professional ” phone reviews rave about this phone . But they only used it for a few hours , maybe a couple of days . This has been my personal experience , do what you want with it . As for me , I ' m deactivating this phone and going back to my iPhone 7 . This was a horrible experience and a regretful purchase .\n",

No settings to change app icons back to old version . No setting to change the battery icon to say percentage - hard to read the tiny battery symbol Pros - - regular camera is fine , night mode is cool I guess - not having bloat ware , having control over what apps I have or don ' t have is nice .

Battery lasts for about 4 - 5 days . And it was much , much cheaper than other phones . ( hmmm , wonder why ? ) First and most importantly , it constantly tell me I have no signal . I haven ' t moved , and have been with my carrier for many , many years , and this phone is the only phone that can ' t find the signal . Constantly . As in most of the time . Usage is not intuitive . It does many other very annoying things , and I can ’ t figure out how to make it stop doing the very annoying things . I went online for a user manual and the link sent me to a site to set up your new Pixel . Um , already done – where ’ s the user manual ? There is no user manual – too bad , so sad . Also , a search of google , ironically , reaps no results on how to make the very annoying things stop . It is possible this phone is customizable , but you have to be a google master phone engineer to figure it out , and they ’ re sure as stuff not going to tell you . Bottom line for me was money . Calls generally work ok , as does text . But email ? Holy C , you ' d think I was asking it to do something easy ! I have to slog through a full crap - load of automatic and unwanted questions ( can ’ t answer the call without a question about contacts , can ’ t read a text without question about contacts , etc . ) before I can do the common things . I do wonder if google even knows you can do that later IF you want to at all ? So annoying ! I also wish it had a home button as I ' m forever accidentally calling people when swiping up which , as far as I have learned to date , appears to be the only way to get to the home screen and jumps right through contacts . Also have to go to home screen if I send an email because it kicks me out . If I want to read and respond to the next email , gotta start anew from the home screen . Stupid . Would not buy this phone again , although I think google could easily fix the operating system . I wonder if they ever will , though . Doubt it . Very disappointing .\n",

I have no problem with the embedded screen camera and I ' m not sure how anyone would find it that bothersome - it ' s kind of cute . The only thing I find annoying is in the \u001b[31m<software:Negative Confidence:0.9775>\u001b[0m not the hardware , I ' d like to be able to disable right - edge back - swipe , for certain apps . But you can reduce the detection area .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1847: I went from a Galaxy S7 to this Pixel 4A 5 days ago . So far I like it . It is very similar to the S7 in overall size , but without the bezels the screen is bigger . Most functions seem similar , I ' m not sure what the raves about a \" pure Android experience \" are about . I don ' t trust and don ' t use either the facial recognition or fingerprint reader , so I just gave them a middle star rating . The speakers are loud enough for me and I have a some age related hearing deficit . I ' ve always used an ATT store to set up my phones before , but they told me they no longer do that for unlocked phones , despite paying upfront for their network for the past 8 years . I followed Google ' s online instructions for transferring the data from my S7 and they worked fine . The only irritating thing was that the directions said the box contained an adapter for attaching a USB C cable to a USB micro ; it doesn ' t . It is an adapter for connecting a full size USB to the USB C in the box . So I had to go get a full size USB to USB Micro cable . Overall , I can ' t see a lot of difference between this phone and my previous S7 , except that I now get security updates for Android and the S7 no longer does . Why pay $ 700 + for a \" flagship phone \" when this does the job for half the price or much less ? And 5G ? Give me a break . Lots of hype and no benefits so far . I don ' t expect to see a benefit in my rural area for many years and it still doesn ' t work any better than 4G LTE in downtown Denver where my wife ' s office is . So , a middle of the line phone works very well and this was the best I could find for my purposes .\n",

Also the curvature of the side well complimented the gesture navigation ( going back gesture ) . - full display mode on youtube is awesome as expected ( the bottom left punch hole is rarely noticeable due to its position in horizontal mode ) . Although the space between the top edge of the display and the status bar is quite noticable and would ' ve been better if the gap was shorter . - also the display brightness seems slightly lower than the pixel 3 but nothing serious . - haptics feels identical to the Pixel 3 and happy that google did not cheap on this part . - apps not supporting the display ratio / size has a slim cutoff on the bottom of the display . Also , the status bar part is unutilised on all apps , which is a bummer but again not critical . - photo takes a split second more to process / save right after taking one , but besides this occasion I don ' t feel any noticeable processing speed difference on daily tasks compared to the Pixel 3 ( probably gaming will feel materially different but personally I don ' t game with my phone so no complaints on processing power ) .

Whatever plastic they used to make the 3a is long gone , this thing feels like a cheap toy in comparison . The screen is good , but at what cost ? A chunk in the corner is dedicated to the camera . Gross . Software ? You would think that something designed by the company that makes the software and OS would have a handle on things . Ha . I have to reset the phone almost daily because apps will auto - crash upon opening them . I do not install that many apps on my phone - I ' ve installed a grand total of 4 . But it ' s nice , I ' m sure it ' s a feature . I bet that Google added that on purpose in hopes of reducing screen time . It ' s wonderful when I need to check something in a pinch . I sold it at a huge loss . Guess what ? The person I sold the three day old phone for 200 dollars sold it to someone else after a day . The cycle continues . Do yourself a favour and skip this one unless you like wasting money . I ' d even get an iPhone SE ( 1st gen ) over this piece of junk .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1889: Hello Reader , First of all , I would like to clarify one thing , I bought Google Pixel 4a for one reason and one reason only , which is : To flash and try GrapheneOS and CalyxOS on Google Pixel 4a So , If you are looking for any Android phone , please think twice before buying Google Pixel 4a . I placed the order on \" Feb 4th 2021 \" , and I received it on \" Feb 7th 2021 \" , I live in Bahrain and the phone sold by \" Triplenet Pricing INC \" in USA , That was really impressive to get the phone in just two days . Pros : 1 - Very good speaker sound , for a small phone . 2 - good screen resolution and touch . 3 - good reception for carrier signal . 4 - Only Google Apps installed by default . 5 - ironically , Google Pixel devices meet the stringent privacy and security standards , that is why it ' s supported by GraphenOS and CalyxOS Cons : 1 - I consider it expensive for its HW specs , there are other good brands in the market with higher specs with same or less price with really good feel and touch and good chassis , for example : OnePlus 7 . 2 - the phone edges have air pockets , you feel it and hear sound when you softly press on the edges , the body is polycarbonate unibody , what do you expect . 3 - Forget to use the phone without an armor case and screen protector , you will lose it very quickly if you did not . Conclusion : If you are just looking for an android phone and you do not care about the brand , think twice before you buy Google Pixel 4a , you can find a better phone with same or lees price . Buy Google Pixel 4a only if you really want to , and you have your own reasons to do that , as I do .\n",
      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1890: Okay , I ' m switching from a Redmi note 8 pro to the google pixel 4a . I have mixed feelings about this device . I ' ll get to the picture part at the end . This device is small . Iphone 6s is about the same size both in length and width . It feels super cheap . Like a prepaid phone that costs $ 80 dollars at your local walgreens . The interface is not snappy and quick like the YouTube reviewers say it is . It is average . My budget Redmi note 8 pro costs 200 dollars less than this device and it ' s a better experience . I found the fingerprint reader doesn ' t always work , when it works it feels like ages to actually unlock . The same thing with entering a pin . It feels like it takes a long time to actually unlock . Who is this phone for ? Someone who isn ' t really on a phone all the time , it ' s not a powerhouse scrolling Instagram is okay YouTube is okay , the small display is just a let down . I don ' t know what model the youtubers are showing you because this device is small . Like really small . Like this would be fine for a child . Okay the camera . Beautiful pictures in good light , okay pictures in really low light , now comes the bad part about the camera . In areas that have light but it ' s not dark enough for night mode the pictures come out noisy and grainy . Like indoors at 4 pm . For $ 350 I strongly recommend a Xiaomi device .

I got it from Amazon only 3 days after official release . I love it . Nothing about it feels inferior to the Pixel XL . I was able to connect a USB - C cable and transfer my files and settings in about 20 minutes . I also connected to my main Win 10 machine and updated my music on the new phone and everything went without a hitch . I found this upgrade process so much easier and smoother than when I upgraded the two family I - phones ( 6 + and 7 + to 11 ) Christmas 2019 . Once I set everything up I checked performance and found the new 4a very snappy . My use is mostly web browsing , email . news , a bit of shopping and Facebook . Nothing challenging , so I loaded up YouTube TV and watched it in small and full screen while I transferred some of the music files . I saw no slow downs in playback or the transfer . From my limited testing around the home office , the camera is pretty nice . The speakers are about on par with the original Pixel and about what I expected . The speakers sound fine . With a headphone jack and Bluetooth 5 . 0 , better sound is simple enough to remedy . I know this isn ' t in depth or a long term review , but in the 24 hours I have had this phone its been great .

What you are buying here is the right to use Google services directly , with no hope of avoiding their highest possible quantity of ads , short of rooting the phone , which obviously compromises security . Above all else , this is an advertising device , and it should be free of initial cost for that reason . Google makes 80 % of their revenue from ads . I assume 80 % of that 80 % is directly sucked from the bloodstream of the 1 , 500 sorry sods that own this phone . - Camera is bad . Blurry image quality ( think iPhone 4 - 5 ) and the worst focus / light balance / color balance of any phone I ' ve ever used . - full Google bloatware suite - touchscreen constantly registers false touches , which renders multiple functionality completely inaccessible for > 50 % of the time , including pinch - zooming and typing . It ' s a well known problem . Google knows about it , but has never commented . We know they know , because if you look this problem up on the Google support forum , you ' ll find many threads where people start discussing the problem , and the thread is locked as soon as forum admins find it . Many people say it ' s because of the low quality of display - the display of the Pixel 4a will often have glue leak onto the toushcreen , which is kind of like having someone put their finger on your screen about half the time . - Screen sucks . Despite high pixel density and good actual screen image , the screen sucks . It has an incredibly thin glass panel that breaks at the slightest shock . Drop it from waist level and watch it turn into a safety hazard quickly . - Short battery life , always dead by the end of the day if I don ' t charge it , and I don ' t use my phone frequently or watch videos often . I hate this thing . Truly the worst phone I have ever used , it makes me pine for my ad - free Cricket flip phone experience . Amazon already deleted this review once , I assume because a Google admin found my review and reported me . If you ' re reading this . . . take your $ 450 and go buy a refurbished iPhone .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 1933: Disclaimer : The below opinion on this phone considers the fact that this is a budget device . Love this phone - that ' s the gist of below review . For the price , the value for money it provides is really unparalleled . There ' s nothing better you can get in this price range in the market . Anyone who wants to spend less and wants a great phone , this is what you should buy . WHATS IN THE BOX Phone , Charging brick and cable , USB to USB type C adapter , SIM ejection tool and some paperwork MY THOUGHTS It cannot be compared to the mighty expensive phones - the iPhones and the high end Galaxy S phones . They are more than double or triple the price of this phone but do provide double or triple features as compared to this phone ? The answer is NO . Let me elaborate . CAMERA : Writing about Camera first as that ' s the most striking feature about this phone . In one word , the camera is awesome and super convenient . It is arguably the best phone camera for still photography in the world . Pictures are crisp and clear , with great detail , vivid colors which are very close to being natural and great dynamic range . Also must add that the camera so is super easy to use . I love it for it ' s simplicity . You can pull it out and start clicking photos rightaway . It has fast focus which makes it a great point and shoot device . And what about night photography , it ' s just awesome , even in the lowest of light , it can capture great detail . The photos aren ' t grainy at all . A couple of photos of my kitchen garden are attached as a sample , taken in pitch darkness . It also has an astrophotography mode but yet to use it . The front facing camera is also great . The picture quality is excellent and the bokeh effect also works very well for portrait shots . In fact would say that this phone captures perhaps the best bokeh shots without using a telephoto lens . Both the back and the front camera are excellent in this regard SOFTWARE : it is pure Android . Out of the box , it came with Android 10 . And just this morning when I checked , Android 11 was available for download . Which phone company will give you latest software updates so regularly ( except Apple ) . Plus google has promised to provide software updates for at least 3 years for all their devices . Samsung announced very recently that they would support their devices for 3 years with software updates but we all know that the updates will be slow to come by . At the end of it , there ' s nothing better than pure Android . BATTERY LIFE & CHARGING SPEED : In my observation , the battery life is quite good and easily lasts me a day of normal use . Some observations attached in pictures . There are two ways in which the battery life was observed - one without power saving option on ( you can toggle it via the pull down menu ) and one with the power saving option on . Without the power saving option , got the phone to last more than a day with almost 5 hours of screen on time . The ambient display was on and that took quite a bit of battery so you ' d have to be careful with that . There ' s also the always on display but it will certainly hog battery life . With the power saving option on , got the phone to last a little less than 2 days with 5 hours on screen on time . This is great . I am sure that with Android 11 now coming , the battery life will only improve even more . The advertised battery capacity is 3140 mAh . The box includes a wall charger which is 18W . It ' s not as fast as some of the other premium phones but good enough for me . I wish wireless charging was present even at a slower speed but not a big deal . BUILD QUALITY : yes the back of the phone is plastic but still it is sleek and has a very decent build for the price . The weight is nicely and evenly distributed and it doesn ' t feel cheap at all . It quite light actually which is good as well . It doesn ' t feel as premium as a glass back phone but still very close . In any case , most people would put a cover on this so who cares if it ' s plastic or a glass back . Also , plastic provides better durability as glass is more prone to cracking . You can actually use it without the case but with an edge to edge glass screen protector . HEADPHONE JACK : Yes , there ' s a headphone jack at the top of the phone . And its a moment to rejoice as most of the known brands these days don ' t have a headphone jack . To me it is super convenient as all my wired headsets work so well with this . With other phones either have to use an Adapter or a blue tooth device which is also ok but nothing replaces a 3 . 5 mm headphone jack . You can quickly plug in your high impedance headset and enjoy listening to music . DUAL STEREO SPEAKER SYSTEM : This is one of the features which is found mostly in more premium phones . And this phone has it . It has a speaker at the top of the phone and another one is on the edge which is bottom firing . Overall it creates a good effect when watching youtube videos . SCREEN SIZE : The screen size is 5 . 8 in which is small when compared to other large phones . But to be honest , its quite ok . It has a punch hole front facing camera but very good decision to keep it in the corner rather than the center . Keeping it in the corner make the view rather unobtrusive while watching videos or photos . SCREEN QUALITY : the screen is AMOLED which is always preferable over LCD panels . It has deep blacks , good contrast and viewing angles . Mind you it ' s not the highest quality OLED panel and you can tell it when you compare it with high end Samsung phones . But again for the price , it is quite good . It is 1080p screen which is more than enough for day to day use . One observation here is that even indoors , the phone doesn ' t feel bright enough , it has to be kept at 75 - 80 % brightness to be able to use it comfortably . For Samsung phones , keeping the phones at 40 - 45 % brightness suffices . PERFORMANCE , RAM & MEMORY : The phone is powered by a mid - range snapdragon processor . It ' s an octacore 730G processor which is certainly not the best but more than good enough for day to day tasks of browsing the internet , news apps , watching youtube videos , playing some low end games . You can actually play some high end games as well but the performance was just about ok . The G in the processor name conveys that it provides improved graphics . But do see some frames dropping here and there while graphically intense games . But it wasn ' t intrusive or distracting in any way . An occasional stutter here and there does happen but largely good . The phone comes with 6 GB of RAM which is more than enough for multi - tasking and keeping the apps in memory . Storage is 128 GB which I feel is more than good enough , you don ' t need anything more than that to be honest as Google provides free cloud storage at optimal image quality through Google photos . What ' s not there : following features are not there as compared to high end phones : no water proofing or IP rating , no glass back , no wireless charging , no face unlock , no in screen fingerprint scanner ( it does have a fingerprint scanner on the back and it works very well ) , no telephoto lens , no wide angle camera , no expandable storage via microsd card . All of these are present in more premium phones but really do you need all of these bells and whistles . Perhaps wide angle camera is the only one I miss . In summary , this phone ticks all the boxes considering its price and you just can ' t go wrong with it . It ' s a lot of phone for the price .\n",

I would say you got to know what you are doing . Not saying anyone can do get it to run so quickly out of the box without help .

Double the storage than my last phone , a better camera , better screen , fantastic OS , updates for three years , free google photos storage . . and all for 50 $ less than my previous phone ! The camera is the selling point for me . It is just as good as the cameras on flagship phones , and it ' s only one camera . Google ' s software really seriously kicks ass . The touch screen is snappy and I don ' t find myself wishing it was faster , it responds immediately to touch , scrolls fast and looks vibrant . The screen to body ratio is perfect , really great job removing bezels . The hole punch is not at all irritating , I ' ve had the phone about three weeks now and I am completely used to it . It blends in and works well with what is on the screen and there are plenty of wallpapers to suit it . It is much better than a notch of a bezel . It looks cool I think . The base storage being 128GBs is seriously nuts . My last phone I only got 64gbs , because in order to get the 128gb version it was $ 100 more ! With 128gbs and free google storage , I can ' t imagine needing more space ever , really .

This is honestly the first pixel that I have been somewhat disappointed with , although the $ 350 price tag definitely tempers my disappointment . I use a liquid glass screen protector and the official Google fabric case and I honestly have zero real complaints about the build quality . The screen is great , the buttons are tactile and responsive , the fingerprint reader is amazing , and the camera is excellent as usual . Phone speakers kind of suck but who really cares . My big complaint is the software , it ' s often gummy and unresponsive . Apps will occasionally freeze , and sometimes touch screen controls become unresponsive or buggy while using an app . This doesn ' t happen very often , maybe once every week or two , but when it does happen it really pisses me off . I had problems like this happen for like a week on my pixel 3 xl before it was fixed with a software update . It ' s been a problem for like 6 months with my 4a and it still happens .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 2014: So I have had zero issues with the fingerprint reader . It is actually been really good for letting me in and nobody else in . I even put a case on mine and I can still reach the finger reader so I actually think it ' s really great it ' s much easier for me to get into my phone compared to my old one . What I like about this phone too is that it is thinner . I used to have the Moto x charge and that was definitely much wider and I didn ' t realize how much more uncomfortable it is . Now when I pick that one up to try and compare to this one it ' s such a beast in such a tank . Whereas this new phone it ' s thinner and slimmer and can actually like fit in my palm so it ' s in my hand and then it can sit nicely on my finger like if I ' m holding it like cut . Which is very nice and I can reach everything on it with my thumb . The fact that the screen is the entire phone face is still giving me the exact same size as my old phone just I no longer have a big phone because it didn ' t take up the whole screen it had sides on it before so I really like that this one is the whole screen and that it ' s slimmer . I have a nice case on it and I have a screen protector on the front and I ' m still able to use everything the same and everything is functioning fine . My only thing is yes the battery does last all day , my old phone my battery could last a couple days but it was an ex - charge and the battery was supposed to do that . But the bonus about this phone here is it does tell me if I keep continuing using it at the rate that I am it tells me about when my phone will die the estimated die time for the battery . So that ' s easy for me to be like oh okay well I ' m going to be going and doing this so maybe I should charge it now . But I typically only charge it at night when I ' m going to sleep . it does have a spam detection for calls which I didn ' t realize was a thing and I ' ve had a couple phone calls like pop up but never ring and then they go away and I am notified that they were spam and then I have verified and they actually are indeed spam . So that has been really nice . I also like that I can give names to my group chats . Everything seems to be running very smoothly and fast at least faster than what I ' m used to . it did take a little getting used to for me to do the back button cuz there was no back button I couldn ' t figure it out but if you just hold off to the side a little bit it is actually much easier to go back and forth between things I ' ve found . my screen now has five icons across compared to my old one that had only four icons across so for me that ' s fine because I can see them fine I haven ' t looked to see if I can change that . So if you are maybe hard on seeing that might not be a benefit but otherwise for me since I don ' t have that problem this is great I really also like that I can just click on the time and date on the phone and it pulls up my calendar or the weather I don ' t have to go search for a different app I just click on it on my phone and it just takes me to that app . my other favorite thing is that it is still an Android phone I absolutely love the Android app I even have my tablets in Android because I ' m just so used to Android and I prefer Android over the counterpart . Like I really dislike Apple and Apple I think is so much more expensive . another fun thing is the night mode I set a bedtime for me and when it ' s my bedtime if I ' m staying up it goes into a black and white scale mode so everything is in black and white so then I go all right fine yep it ' s bedtime . I also like the do not disturb because I can have things blocked for when I ' m sleeping so my phone isn ' t ringing or anything and I don ' t have to remember to put it on silent it was automatically does that . Unless of course it ' s emergency it is set to if somebody calls back within a 10 - 15 minute window that it will ring because it ' s a priority call and I have that turned on . I haven ' t even come close to using all the storage space that I have on my phone . Whereas my old phone I was constantly having to delete things to get a new app if I wanted to and it was very hard to do , so I like the extra space I like how fast it works and I like the thinness of it actually . As for phone calls and stuff I don ' t have an issue with the speaker or the earpiece very simple to use and my camera is still working nicely I I still get really nice pictures . this one does say that it ' s for all carriers and I have Xfinity mobile , and when I got the phone I checked the number against their oh is your phone compatible on the website and it wasn ' t . I was very frustrated I even set up to start a new return with this but then , I was on with the people on chat and I was trying to figure it out and I even said I was going to try and go somewhere else . But here ' s the thing even though that they wouldn ' t help me and they kind of have some sucky customer service . I have a very cheap bill with them I just have to have my cable with them to get them and then each month it ' s just I think it ' s like $ 12 per gigabyte of data that you use and since I don ' t use data I don ' t have a bill each month because my phone is paid off I have nothing else going on there so I have a really great deal with them so I want to keep with them so . So before I decided to actually ship it back I pulled my chip card out of my old phone and slid it into this one here and eureka ! My phone actually works really well I didn ' t have to change anything with my carrier all I had to do was change my SIM card and the phone is compatible even if they tell you it ' s not compatible So I would say give that a try if you do have Xfinity , and then if it works great if not I ' m sorry you ' ll have to look for something else considering the stage shouldn ' t work but mine works and I ' ve been doing it for two months now and haven ' t had any disruptions with my service everything has been great and I haven ' t had to change my billing at all so I have really enjoyed having this phone .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 2023: At this price point , the Google Pixel 4a is almost perfect . Coming from a flagship user I was definitely skeptical about the 4a , that is , until I had it running and in my hands . Here ' s some key points : Screen : Very clean gorilla glass 3 - almost edge to edge display along with the hole - punch camera . The camera hole is a bit bigger than the others , but again for the price , it ' s easily forgivable . The screen is very crisp for 1080p , it ' s just lacking brightness . There isn ' t fast refresh available , but it doesn ' t bother me . Body : The body is plastic , which is fine because it feels nice , fingerprints can ' t be seen and it should be more durable than glass . The only thing I see being different than what I ' m used to is the weight of this device , its so light it feels like it disappears in your pocket but almost feels too light in the hands . Not bad just not what I ' m used to . The back of the phone is where the fingerprint scanner is located and its very fast in my experience . Cameras : Only a single camera module in the rear which is expected for the price . This camera is surprisingly good , great detail , auto focus , portraits and videos . Front module is not as impressive , but certainly usable . Chipset : This device has a Snapdragon730 paired with 6gb of RAM and it ' s really snappy . I ' m not sure if it ' s a lack of bloatware , but transitioning between apps was smooth and made it feel like more of a premium phone . Storage for this device is fixed at 128gb with no expansion available . Battery : Is a 3140mah Li - po unit that lasted an entire day for me and I consider myself a heavy user . Charging is available at 18w which is nice for charging to 100 % in about 1 . 5hrs . This phone offers reverse charging via USB , but I never used this feature . It does not support wireless charging but that ' s OK because I ' m sure it keeps the price down and I don ' t use wireless charging all the time . Overall I ' m quite impressed by this little , but powerful device . It ' s a perfect phone for someone getting into smartphones or someone who doesn ' t want to break the bank replacing an old phone . The only con I saw using this device was the sound quality ; Anything above 50 - 60 % and the body vibrates a lot and the sound quality just isn ' t great . Other than that I would highly recommend the Google Pixel 4a .\n",

Very annoying in games and any app with buttons way at the right / bottom .

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 2026: Cheap inferior phone ( in all aspects ) except the camera . And by cheap I mean cheap . The body and screen are decent , however , the speaker quality is so dismal I am considering to selling it . 4a is at least a decent ( ish ) value for money and the camera punches above its weight . I initially got Pixel 5 but had to sell it because it had very much the same issues except it cost $ 650 . The whole experience of 4a is very imbalanced . I miss the audio quality and materials of my Samsung Galaxy S7 every minute and that is a five year old phone . The drop in quality is shocking . If you use the phone as a phone , something designers at Goggle probably don ' t , you ' ll want to hurl it through the window soon . It is practically unusable as a speaker phone which is something the competition does usually very well . The loudspeaker accentuates any minor issues participants may have with their lines : the one that is a tad too bassy buzzes and sounds hollow , faint lines sound fainter etc . Samsung figured this out years back ! Similarly , you will almost never be able to set the loudness level correctly between ringtones , alarms , media volumes between loudspeaker use and headphone use . Imagine you set your ringtone so that you can hear it in normal use . Then you switch to headphones to play a song . Then someone calls you . Your eardrums will almost explode because the phone is too dumb to adjust for headphones ! Perhaps I am too focussed on the audio quality . But for me it is a key function . There is a lot of hype about Google products but substance is simply not there . Google sells you cheap iron designed by a team who really do not know how to make it work together . And a good camera . However , the competition caught up with the latter as well . I am still considering selling this phone too . Not happy .\n",

      "[2023-08-10 17:18:43] (2.3.1) Example 2033: The Pixel \" a \" series of phones seems like a great deal , delivering an excellent camera at an excellent price . Unfortunately , they are too good to be true - the quality and reliability are so compromised that I can ' t tolerate them any more . I previously had the 3a , and that screen cracked 3 times on me - no other smart phone screen has ever cracked for me . After the third ruined screen , I replaced it with the 4a . The 4a ' s SIM card reader broke in less than a year . I tried replacing the SIM card but the phone remained nonfunctional - meaning the phone , messages , and mobile data don ' t work ( although it ' s still a computer that works over WiFi ) . I ordered a replacement under warranty , and Google - get this - shipped it GROUND from Chicago to California . It took a week to arrive . And when the replacement arrived , it lasted less than a day . The replacement phone got stuck in boot mode as soon as I transferred my data ( the picture ) , and I can ' t even perform a factory reset . I contacted support , and they can ' t factory reset the phone either . Now I want to return the replacement phone , and Google is refusing to provide a shipping label to return the broken phone until they receive and process the original phone . So that would be an additional 2 - week delay if we go through returning the original phone , processing it , returning the replacement phone , and shipping a new one . I ' d be out of a phone for 3 weeks . Anyway , no more Pixels for me - apparently the cheap price reflects such cheap components that the phones aren ' t reliable , and I need to have a working phone . NOTE : After a request to escalate the problem , multiple weeks , lots of emails , and two separate shipments for returns , Google fully refunded me for the original phone . I believe this is over and above what the warranty required , and so I ' ve upgraded from 1 to 3 stars .\n",

I know old phones create a problem at disposal for our planet , so I have been holding onto the old one for many years . In fact , it was my first mobile phone . So switching to a new phone for me is similar to buying a 2015 car with computer and electronics vs my 20 year old car with none . I expect I will be using this for some time without having a clue how to use all its features . So I will just address the basics . The power button is in a horrible place and I am forever hitting it . So that sucks . It is thankfully silver , so at least it is easy to see . And the phone is motion activated , so having the screen light up on pick up is a feature I can get used to fast ! Screen resolution is a huge improvement as are many basics . Just had my first spam call and was delighted to have the option to reply with Google ' s spam filter and messaging that asks the caller to leave their id and message . I saw it in real time as text to confirm it was a caller looking to sell something . The ring tones are nice too , the message function kinda clunky , system settings were difficult to find , so much so I eventually created a desktop shortcut to access them . The recorded audio quality sounds muffled ( when I set up my vm message ) and the camera , which I though would be exceptional , oddly interprets some colors . I use it to post pics of my paintings to Instagram , and it couldn ' t tell the difference between teal and blue . Battery life is good . To transfer data between the new phone and the old was a pain because only after contacting tech support did I find out the enclosed usb cable ONLY works between Pixel phones ! They really should include info like that with the cable / instructions and alert you when you buy . I had to buy a new cable for this one time use and wait until I had it in hand before I could transfer my contact list , etc . This phone cost me more than my Dell desktop computer and large screen . I think it ' s highway robbery what this and other even more expensive phones cost , but it is what it is . The position of the on switch exactly where you hold it , really is lousy design that I have to deal with every time I pick it up .\n",

My least favorite part about getting a new phone is transferring all my previous data to a new device , but Android to Android makes this process so streamlined , I had all my music , photos , apps , wallpapers , and smaller settings in about 15 minutes from when I first booted the phone up . A few things I think that makes this device stand out is that it ' s like an iPhone XS with an Android OS running it . The display is clear and sharp , the touch is consistent , the camera is superb for the price that you pay , and the software is rather simple and clean to use . If you ' re concerned about the punch - out camera in the top left of the screen like I was , don ' t worry . It ' s barely noticeable when using the device like normal . This phone ' s size is pretty comfortable when it comes to one handed use . The matte finish on the back side gives the device a nice feel when it ' s being used .

No surprise , it ' s not as good as the iPhone 11 . But again , for the money , it ' s really good . Filmic Pro will overheat the phone when shooting in high resolutions and frame rates , but that ' s expected on Android anyway .

Works quickly , has a moderate amount of stock space , the camera is decent ; the one low - point may be the speaker which isn ' t that impressive . An improvement over its similar predecessor the A10 , this A10 - S includes a fingerprint scanner which works great , as well as an improved location for the speaker ( on the bezel of the phone instead of on the back which was easily muffled ) — yet , it ' s priced almost identically to its predecessor . I will say one thing , I first bought a \" defective \" A10S and had to return it for a replacement , but I wasn ' t even sure if it was a one - off defect until I bought another one which didn ' t end up having the problem . The issue I had was that the touch screen was less responsive along the side edges of the screen , so when I tried to press keys like \" P \" , or \" L \" , or the backspace button it didn ' t always respond to my touch . The top pull - down menu also didn ' t work when the phone was flat . I thought it might have just been something I had to deal with because of the economical value of the phone , but it WAS a defect .

I clicked on the \" buy it again \" button on my order page expecting to get the same phone . I did not . It looked the same but there were important differences . The first clue that something was wrong was the adapters in the box which were not compatible with any electrical outlet I have . Next , after transferring all my data I noticed several unusual things . Any app that spoke had a british accent ( which I didn ' t mind , but seemed odd ) . My weather app is set to 24 hour time and no matter how often I change it to 12 hour , it always reverts back to 24 hour . The dates on my email are listed as day / month / year so that March 20th would read 20 / 3 / 20 . I then discovered an insert in the instructions informing me that the phone was from India and should be activated with a sim card issued in India . If I used a sim issued from another region the phone might not function properly . I live in Pennsylvania and that is where my sim card was issued . I called customer service , explained the situation and they sent me a new phone , assuring me that my experience was a mistake that would not happen again . My 2nd new phone came , again with the weird adapters and sure enough , a card that said the phone was an Indian phone to be activated with a sim card issued in India . That phone is also going back and I have ordered a completely different phone . Read the phone description carefully before purchasing . If it says International phone , do not order it !\n",

This phone has three slots in its card tray , two for nano SIMs plus a dedicated microSD slot , so no sacrifice is necessary . Has an FM radio chip and includes wired ear buds to use as an antenna . Minimal bloatware , only thing I ' d like to delete but can ' t is Facebook . Flashlight is super bright but only has one brightness level , 100 % , unlike my previous Samsung which had four . No magnetic compass sensor , which is no biggie with GPS or if you can determine heading from the sun , moon , and time . No NFC so no support for contactless payment . Speaker location on the bottom edge to the left of the Micro USB port is unfortunate . . . my natural operating mode is left handed using the thumb to type and little finger to balance the phone , which blocks the speaker . Speaker is also blocked if I hold the phone against my body to stabilize . Speaker is plenty loud and sounds great . Wish it had a USB Type C port and quick charging capability . Display is very sharp , plenty bright . Software supports pretty much any language on the planet . . . at first turn - on , Español is the default , so pull down to US English if that ' s your preference . Easy peasy . No problems getting it to work on Metro by T - Mobile . . . just have to register the IMEI through one of their flirty customer service call center reps , who will waive the $ 15 fee if you go that route instead of taking it to a store . Had I asked for her number , she probably would have shot back with 611 LOL !

My weather app is set to 24 hour time and no matter how often I change it to 12 hour , it always reverts back to 24 hour .

I then discovered an insert in the instructions informing me that the phone was from India and should be activated with a sim card issued in India . If I used a sim issued from another region the phone might not function properly . I live in Pennsylvania and that is where my sim card was issued . I called customer service , explained the situation and they sent me a new phone , assuring me that my experience was a mistake that would not happen again . My 2nd new phone came , again with the weird adapters and sure enough , a card that said the phone was an Indian phone to be activated with a sim card issued in India .

If it & . . . moreWhat makes it an great UI you ask me ? Plenty of reasons , like : 1 . Animations and transitions in every tap , swipe , scroll gesture you make . It is very good in 90 / 120hz displays . You simply just notice it the difference between 90 and 60hz . Whereas stock android and oxygenos doesn ' t have those animations , so high refresh rates doesn ' t look as good as MIUI . 2 . Plenty of customization , you can change icons , super wallpapers , themes , lock , charging / fingerprint animation 3 . Just like the first point , every actiom you do will have an haptic feedback , yes even cheap phones from Xiaomi do . So even if the feedback isn ' t as good , it is still better than not getting an feedback . In Xiaomi Flagships , the feedback for every action you do even outclasses Apple ' s Taptic engine and Ios . 4 . Promised Updates for at least 3 generations of MIUI ( not android ) no matter what phones you choose , cheap or super cheap . I mean , even Redmi Note 7 , which ships with Android 9 , gets Android 11 and 3 versions of MIUI , sure you will not get Android 12 , but you will later get MIUI 12 . 5 which is better than Oneplus giving only 1 years of updates . Even though the update is a bit slow , but still better than not getting updates . Even Realme , Oneplus , Oppo , Vivo , Huawei , Samsung entry level phones only gets one year updates . 4 . Plenty of featues , like scollshot , screen recorder , DC dimming , vibration customization , clear speaker , and even fun ones , like an app exploding in your home screen when you delete it . 5 . Extreme levels of details just like Point 1 and 3 . There ' s just so much attention to details . But at cheaper phones , this skin may be a bit too heavy for them . While on high end xiaomi phones , the UI is so awesome and also without ads ( which i don ' t mind ) .

Same applies for my iPhone 11 where it can run at the highest , 30 despite getting very warm ( because it lacks cooling ) . The iPhone 12 clearly had OS issues initially and hence the throttling , where many games would just stutter here and there . Only then after 1 . 2 ( Dragonspine map update ) I have noticed that the game does not run normally as usual in any of my phones . Don ' t blame the lack of cooling , because I visited the Genshin forums in Facebook and also noticed many players having the same issue . It used to be that players with lower end chipset / phones ( ex . Redmi Note 8 w / SD 665 ) were able to play the game , nowadays it will just glitch and get very hot when their device specs meets the requirements . This is not fixed in 1 . 3 .

HDR + enhanced is a fast Night Sight mode and only takes up to 2 . 5 seconds , if you don ' t zoom .

Just like desktops did , phones will start to diverge in processing power as per user needs . We started seeing the \" G \" branded processors , and soon that would extend to things beyond a boost in GPU clock speed : Think of having an Intel i7 with a integrated graphics and Intel i7 with a discrete RTX3080 . Both are flagship chipsets , but gaming on them ( for those requiring it ) is a night - and - day difference . System price is quite different as well . Today , the SD765 is closer to an i5 with a 1050Ti , for example , and the SD865 is an i7 with RTX3080 . . . Can you really say that everyone needs an i7 with RTX3080 ? I don ' t think so Can you not play pretty much every game out there on an i5 with GTC 1050i ? of you course you could at various degrees of resolution / quality degradations . Also , are there not premium laptops with i5s ? sure thing And thus , we are now heading into this trend , and I guess we will start seeing SD8x5 and SD8x5G processors as well as SD7x5 and SD 7x5G processors powering up phones , probably even the same phone model with just the processor / memory variations . Apple so far is doing the opposite with keeping the same flagship chipset and downgrading the design on its various tiers , but that too I believe will soon change ; but Apple will always be Apple , they will do whatever they feel like waking up in the morning and everybody will applaud and follow : D\n",

Good lord that they added the option to shoot in RAW . There is still a room for improvements in the way Oppo / Vivo / OnePlus handles the images , but Xiaomi is getting there and Huawei is definitely the best in terms of the detail rendering / noise reduction , though the digital crop they apply by default hurts the per - pixel sharpness quite a bit . As for colours , you can turn off the AI to make it look a lot more natural , as I already said before . iPhones have nice colours ( if a bit too cold and greenish in many scenario ) and their night mode is easily one of the best , but the amount of compression , sharpening and local contrast boost they apply during the day are hilariously excessive and on top of that photos still look like they have come out of a small sensor like those from Pixel . As far as I could tell I don ' t see a whole lot of difference between 12 Pro and 11 Pro , but I guess the situation would be slightly better on 12 Pro Max that comes with the brand new 1 / 1 . 7 \" sensor .\n",

Both the Nord and the FE been tested average , the nord even below average when it comes to photo quality ( even if it offers a better main camera on paper ) . When comparing the OP 8t you also DONT get a telephoto lense and an ultra - wide with 16mp like the pixel 5 one . The OP8t with 5g is 50 - 100 $ more expensive than the pixel 5 ( matter of location ) . Though you get higher MP in the main camera , if you are up for that ( pixel 5 still creates beter photos by software ) . The Nord also misses out on the Qi - charging front and has no USB 3 . 0 or 3 . 1 , has gorilla glass 5 instead of 6 , is made of plastic , BUT has an ultra - wide front cam . You DON ' T get more when choosing 400 $ phones . Most phones at 400 $ , fake around their cameras . They are often below average but always don ' t offer more combinations than wide and Ultrawide , just like the Pixel 5 . There is no need for 2MP Macro - Cameras or depth - cameras . Most 400 $ phones offer 5g only when spending 100 $ more ( cept the Nord , which I already stated has bad cameras ) . The only real alternative to the pixel 5 is the iphone 12 which is near the same size with 6 , 1 \" , better video qualities , Face unlock , mag safe accessoires , etc . , but is also 100 - 200 $ more expensive and YET does NOT offer a telephoto lense ! Also the s20 FE is a true android alternative . Its also the only phone offering wide , ultrawide and telephoto in one phone sub 800 $ , but is much larger with 6 , 5 \" AND it also plays around with prices . You won ' t get an SD865 ( none + ) and no 5g for 700 $ - but only 4G and an much unloved Exynos chipset . And you only get a plastic back in the 700 and 800 $ version .

Still it misses out on the front camera and the ROM offered . The missing 120hz and 6 , 5 \" is up to you guys , most phones will operate in 60hz anyways to save battery .
